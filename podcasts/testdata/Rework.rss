They also offer advice on attracting and retaining the right talent and discuss the role of communication and culture in building a successful team.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Show Notes: </strong></p><p> </p><p>[00:26] - Sarah McKenzie asks for tips on delegating projects rather than tasks and helping team members take ownership of their work areas as she wants to move in this direction with her small team.</p><p>[01:23] - Jason explains how <a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/delegating-projects-not-tasks-f36cb8bc">Basecamp delegates projects instead of tasks</a>. In contrast, team members are given a rough general idea of the project and some ideas for the interface design, and they figure out how to get it done in their own time.</p><p>[02:57] - David adds that even new employees and junior programmers can handle owning a whole project.</p><p>[04:38] - David shares that <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup"><em>Shape Up's</em></a> idea of a fixed time frame and flexible scope interlocks with delegating projects.</p><p>[05:32] - Let people live up to high expectations and see who does it quickly and best. Delegating a project means evaluating work based on outcomes, not effort, allowing team members to make decisions and run autonomously within the project's scope. </p><p>[06:28] - Julio Caesar from Sao Paulo, Brazil, asks DHH about the day-to-day work in a team of two, specifically about code review, pull requests, and dev to production deployments. He's concerned about the time wasted in long change management meetings and how to avoid having someone who doesn't know anything about the project approve a deploy.</p><p>[07:11] - 37signals has teams of two working on different aspects of a product, with any given feature having a designer and a programmer working on it.</p><p>[08:24] - David shares that the company has a process where someone is responsible for the quality of the work that goes out the door. There is a mentorship process for new hires. Programmers and designers review each other's work.</p><p>[08:40] - In the <a href="https://37signals.com/seven-shipping-principles/">Seven Shipping Principles</a>, there is a notion that if the person is confident that the deploy is low-risk, they are not obligated to get a review. Even CTOs and senior employees sometimes request a review to increase their confidence. The team encourages individuals to have a strong sense of confidence and delegate the responsibility of reviews to themselves.</p><p>[09:22] - The review process is asynchronous and shouldn't be a blocker.</p><p>[10:29] - Jason shares that although anyone can deploy work, the company has never had a catastrophic deploy in its history. And rollbacks are very rare.</p><p>[12:38] - A mystery caller asks David and Jason if they have any rules, constraints, or systems in place to help them decide when to grow and when not to grow, specifically around headcount and staffing.</p><p>[13:02] - Jason explains that their hiring is department-based and based on specific needs rather than global goals. They follow the principle of "hire when it hurts" and aim to alleviate actual pain rather than future pain. </p><p>[15:16] - Having two people is better than one—David shares an example where they had only one person in a role, and it was difficult for them to take a vacation or sabbatical without affecting the company. He also suggests that companies should consider redefining a role when someone leaves rather than simply refilling it and only hiring when necessary.</p><p>[17:54] - Jason emphasizes the importance of the "hire when it hurts" principle, especially for startups. He advises it's better to wait for reality to show what is actually needed before making hiring decisions.</p><p>[19:15] - Jason and David discuss the practice of hiring defensively, which involves hoarding talent and contributes to the malaise of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bullshit-Jobs-Theory-David-Graeber/dp/150114331X?&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=kimberlynot0c-20&amp;linkId=9331d6c23ca4b609e34b9b03e43c29ef&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"><em>Bullshit Jobs</em></a>.</p><p>[21:06] - David talks about his experience of having a job where it didn't matter if he did anything and the cruelty of putting people in that position, not to mention the ding on the economy. </p><p>[23:23] - Listener Bhagyesh asks how to find team members that align with work principles and help the business grow without traditional supervision.</p><p>[23:48] - Jason says they find team members through word of mouth and by writing detailed job ads. They get many applications per role but narrow them down by talking to candidates and having them do a small project.</p><p>[25:50]- David stresses the importance of finding someone who matches their principles by incorporating them into the ad. They have been promoting <a href="https://37signals.com/books/#remote"><em>Remote</em></a> work for decades, which helps them find the right people and hire talent from all over the world.</p><p>[28:35] - Kimberly highlights the importance of the tone of the job description. As a previous candidate, she notes that it gives people a sense of the company's culture.</p><p>[29:01] - 37signals' job ads accurately describe the place and give people a sense of how they communicate, which is a big part of attracting the right people.</p><p>[29:33] - Do you have questions for David and Jason about a better way to work and run your business?

In contrast, team members are given a rough general idea of the project and some ideas for the interface design, and they figure out how to get it done in their own time.</p><p>[02:57] - David adds that even new employees and junior programmers can handle owning a whole project.</p><p>[04:38] - David shares that <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup"><em>Shape Up's</em></a> idea of a fixed time frame and flexible scope interlocks with delegating projects.</p><p>[05:32] - Let people live up to high expectations and see who does it quickly and best. Delegating a project means evaluating work based on outcomes, not effort, allowing team members to make decisions and run autonomously within the project's scope. </p><p>[06:28] - Julio Caesar from Sao Paulo, Brazil, asks DHH about the day-to-day work in a team of two, specifically about code review, pull requests, and dev to production deployments. He's concerned about the time wasted in long change management meetings and how to avoid having someone who doesn't know anything about the project approve a deploy.</p><p>[07:11] - 37signals has teams of two working on different aspects of a product, with any given feature having a designer and a programmer working on it.</p><p>[08:24] - David shares that the company has a process where someone is responsible for the quality of the work that goes out the door. There is a mentorship process for new hires. Programmers and designers review each other's work.</p><p>[08:40] - In the <a href="https://37signals.com/seven-shipping-principles/">Seven Shipping Principles</a>, there is a notion that if the person is confident that the deploy is low-risk, they are not obligated to get a review. Even CTOs and senior employees sometimes request a review to increase their confidence. The team encourages individuals to have a strong sense of confidence and delegate the responsibility of reviews to themselves.</p><p>[09:22] - The review process is asynchronous and shouldn't be a blocker.</p><p>[10:29] - Jason shares that although anyone can deploy work, the company has never had a catastrophic deploy in its history. And rollbacks are very rare.</p><p>[12:38] - A mystery caller asks David and Jason if they have any rules, constraints, or systems in place to help them decide when to grow and when not to grow, specifically around headcount and staffing.</p><p>[13:02] - Jason explains that their hiring is department-based and based on specific needs rather than global goals. They follow the principle of "hire when it hurts" and aim to alleviate actual pain rather than future pain. </p><p>[15:16] - Having two people is better than one—David shares an example where they had only one person in a role, and it was difficult for them to take a vacation or sabbatical without affecting the company. He also suggests that companies should consider redefining a role when someone leaves rather than simply refilling it and only hiring when necessary.</p><p>[17:54] - Jason emphasizes the importance of the "hire when it hurts" principle, especially for startups. He advises it's better to wait for reality to show what is actually needed before making hiring decisions.</p><p>[19:15] - Jason and David discuss the practice of hiring defensively, which involves hoarding talent and contributes to the malaise of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bullshit-Jobs-Theory-David-Graeber/dp/150114331X?&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=kimberlynot0c-20&amp;linkId=9331d6c23ca4b609e34b9b03e43c29ef&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"><em>Bullshit Jobs</em></a>.</p><p>[21:06] - David talks about his experience of having a job where it didn't matter if he did anything and the cruelty of putting people in that position, not to mention the ding on the economy. </p><p>[23:23] - Listener Bhagyesh asks how to find team members that align with work principles and help the business grow without traditional supervision.</p><p>[23:48] - Jason says they find team members through word of mouth and by writing detailed job ads. They get many applications per role but narrow them down by talking to candidates and having them do a small project.</p><p>[25:50]- David stresses the importance of finding someone who matches their principles by incorporating them into the ad. They have been promoting <a href="https://37signals.com/books/#remote"><em>Remote</em></a> work for decades, which helps them find the right people and hire talent from all over the world.</p><p>[28:35] - Kimberly highlights the importance of the tone of the job description. As a previous candidate, she notes that it gives people a sense of the company's culture.</p><p>[29:01] - 37signals' job ads accurately describe the place and give people a sense of how they communicate, which is a big part of attracting the right people.</p><p>[29:33] - Do you have questions for David and Jason about a better way to work and run your business?

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode of Rework, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, co-founders of 37signals, join host Kimberly Rhodes to discuss the power of taking sabbaticals as business owners.</p><p>Jason recently returned to work after taking his first sabbatical in nearly 23 years. He and David share their experiences and insights on the benefits of taking extended breaks from work. </p><p>They cover the challenges of stepping away from a business you've built, the importance of trusting your team to handle things in your absence, and the value of returning to work with a fresh perspective. </p><p>Listen in to hear their practical advice for business owners considering taking a sabbatical and the positive impact time away can have on both individuals and the company.</p><p><strong>Show Notes: </strong></p><p> </p><p>[00:43] - Jason shares why he took his first sabbatical in nearly 23 years and how disconnecting completely from work gave him a new perspective. </p><p>[01:49] - David shares his forced sabbatical experience when he had to move to Denmark. He shares his opinion that it's healthy for the organization's resiliency to have its founders step out.</p><p>[04:41] - Why feeling like you can't take a vacation is unhealthy.</p><p>[05:46] - Disconnecting during a sabbatical: Jason shares his experience that portrays the importance of taking time off and what he did during reentry to avoid overwhelm. </p><p>[08:08] - David emphasizes the importance of taking a REAL break and trusting others to carry on, so you can return to work with a clearer mind and a better perspective on what truly matters.</p><p>[09:57] - Jason shares why, if anything had to wait for him to return to be decided, it might be a symptom of overreliance on any one individual.</p><p>[10:30] - Kimberly shares why there's usually a scramble to get things done before a regular vacation and asks how preparing for a sabbatical differs. </p><p>[11:27] - Jason shares the writing he did before taking off.</p><p>[12:23] - David shares his realization that there are big foundational tenants of how they work that will stay the same, even if one of the principles is out for an extended time.</p><p>[14:00] - Shifting the work to get projects where more people can independently drive them.</p><p>[16:38] - Don't fear the sabbatical: remember, you are not as important as you think. Jason advises people to trust their team. </p><p>[17:53] - The importance of enjoying boredom: David shares how sabbaticals allow the mind enough space to work on the business in your head and remind you why you do what you do. </p><p>[19:47] - It's time to answer those questions!

        <![CDATA[<p>Remote work has become increasingly popular in recent years, offering several benefits, such as increased flexibility and the ability to work anywhere globally. </p><p><br></p><p>However, there are some challenges that come with remote work and it’s certainly not for all companies. </p><p><br></p><p>In this episode of the Rework podcast, 37signals co-founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson discuss these issues and how they've overcome them from their book, <a href="https://37signals.com/books/#rework"><em>Rework</em></a>.</p><p><br></p><p>They share insights on how to work together across different time zones, ways to stay connected while working remotely, and the benefits of remote work for both employees and employers. </p><p><br></p><p>Listen in to find out what remote work has to offer, along with its challenges and benefits, from two seasoned advocates.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Show Notes: </strong></p><p> </p><p>[00:36] - 37signals is as remote as they've ever been. </p><p>[01:02] - The challenges of time zones in a remote work environment, especially when training or mentoring new employees. </p><p>[02:22] - Jason discusses the importance of scheduling and pairing employees with compatible time zones, depending on their experience level. </p><p>[03:57] - David shares why from his perspective, four hours is the ideal amount of time zone overlap for remote collaboration.</p><p>[05:32] - Why it's essential to be strategic about where you hire from, given the challenges of time zone differences.</p><p>[06:13] - While asynchronous communication is useful, synchronous communication is needed to crack through some tasks.</p><p>[07:52] - How 37signals twice-yearly meetups are more of an investment than an expense, unlike the cost of an office.</p><p>[08:35] - Humans are not built for fully remote work—why meeting in person is necessary to reduce loneliness, recharge batteries, and create better team relationships.</p><p>[10:57] - Why simply installing communication tools like Slack and Zoom without changing work practices offers the worst of both worlds and results in a subpar remote work experience.</p><p>[12:20] - The potential pitfalls and tradeoffs of the new hybrid work model.</p><p>[14:10] - The benefits of being able to hire the best talent from anywhere in the world and allowing employees the freedom to live and work in multiple locations.</p><p>[16:22] - Jason discusses why some companies are requiring employees to return to the office after the pandemic and both advantages and disadvantages. </p><p>[17:46] - David shares why either way is OK—some companies thrive with having an in-person culture catering to the needs of employees who prefer working in an office, while there should be more remote work options for those who prefer working from home.</p><p>[20:38] - Busting the myth that remote work is impossible, creating more options for people, but the future of work remains to be seen.</p><p>[22:39] - Leave a voicemail at 708-628-7850 or <a href="http://rework@37signals.com">email us</a> with questions for David and Jason about remote work or running a business for a chance to have it answered on an upcoming episode.</p><p><br><strong>Links and Resources:<br></strong><br><a href="https://37signals.com/books/#rework"><em>Rework</em><br></a>Do you have a question for Jason and David?

        <![CDATA[<p>If you follow Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founders of 37signals, anywhere online, you know they aren’t afraid to speak their minds and stand up for what they believe in. </p><p> </p><p>Today, Jason and David sit down to discuss how embracing their viewpoint has led them to go toe-to-toe with some of the industry's biggest behemoths. </p><p>They’ll walk us through some of their biggest battles and what it took to stand their ground while positively impacting the world. They’ll also share tips for when, and how, picking a fight with a competitor can work to your advantage. Plus, more insight from the chapter called "Pick A Fight" in their book, <a href="https://37signals.com/books/"><em>Rework</em></a>.<br></p><p><strong>Show Notes: </strong></p><p> </p><p>[00:41] - Jason shares the reasoning behind their tendency to take a stand online.</p><p>[01:27] - Broken business models: the awkwardness of companies who statistically lose money trying to sell business software. </p><p>[02:49] - David describes how having strong principles and standing firmly behind them puts you in direct competition with companies that run on polar opposite business principles.</p><p>[04:01] - Using the underdog advantage in your marketing = highlighting the things that resonate with the target audience you are trying to reach (and make you look good). </p><p>[05:43] - Don't be afraid of picking on goliath-sized competitors, but be sure you are punching up. </p><p>[07:02] - Be careful of coming off as crass.

        <![CDATA[<p>If you follow Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, the co-founders of 37signals, anywhere online, you know they aren’t afraid to speak their minds and stand up for what they believe in. </p><p> </p><p>Today, Jason and David sit down to discuss how embracing their viewpoint has led them to go toe-to-toe with some of the industry's biggest behemoths. </p><p>They’ll walk us through some of their biggest battles and what it took to stand their ground while positively impacting the world. They’ll also share tips for when, and how, picking a fight with a competitor can work to your advantage. Plus, more insight from the chapter called "Pick A Fight" in their book, <a href="https://37signals.com/books/"><em>Rework</em></a>.<br></p><p><strong>Show Notes: </strong></p><p> </p><p>[00:41] - Jason shares the reasoning behind their tendency to take a stand online.</p><p>[01:27] - Broken business models: the awkwardness of companies who statistically lose money trying to sell business software. </p><p>[02:49] - David describes how having strong principles and standing firmly behind them puts you in direct competition with companies that run on polar opposite business principles.</p><p>[04:01] - Using the underdog advantage in your marketing = highlighting the things that resonate with the target audience you are trying to reach (and make you look good). </p><p>[05:43] - Don't be afraid of picking on goliath-sized competitors, but be sure you are punching up. </p><p>[07:02] - Be careful of coming off as crass. If you're the market leader, ensure you act like it. </p><p>[08:13] - The story of the industry heavyweight that considered taking a run at squashing Basecamp.   </p><p>[09:21] - The big conflict with Apple and the resulting “rocket to the moon” free marketing </p><p>[12:03] - Jason explains the difference between ignoring your competition and picking a fight with them. </p><p>[12:43] - Be aware (but not too aware) so you don't compete in a field you'll never win in as a small business. </p><p>[13:28] - David explains why having confidence in your unique and creative ideas can give small companies a significant strategic advantage.</p><p>[15:07] - It’s important to remember a company's public image is just a sliver of its reality; follow accordingly and stick with being original. </p><p>[17:42] - Why you need to keep your "pick a fight" campaigns organic, and NOT strategic, to keep them from appearing contrived. </p><p>[21:25] - How knowing who you are and what you stand for as a company helps you handle the detractors. </p><p>[23:15] - Picking a fight needs courage and humanity; injecting your principles into your marketing isn’t for the faint of heart. </p><p>[25:31] - Do you have a question for Jason and David?

        <![CDATA[<p>Basecamp released its new email service, HEY, on June 15. It was supposed to be a calm, controlled product launch, but what followed was a period that CEO Jason Fried described as "chaotic, enthralling, (and) horrible."

And Nabiha Syed, president of the new investigative journalism outlet The Markup, talks about their commitment to data minimization—including zero tracking, not even open rates, on their newsletters—and how that affects their relationship with readers.<br><strong><br>Show Notes</strong></p><p><a href="https://basecamp.com/newsletter">Basecamp’s newsletter</a> - 2:34</p><p><a href="https://hey.com">Hey</a> - 3:05</p><p>Andy Didorosi <a href="https://twitter.com/ThatDetroitAndy">on Twitter</a> - 3:29</p><p><a href="https://fs.blog/newsletter/">Farnam Street newsletter</a> - 5:47</p><p>Adam Stoddard <a href="https://twitter.com/adamstddrd?">on Twitter</a> - 7:23</p><p>Mailchimp's <a href="https://mailchimp.com/help/about-postcards/">postcard program</a> | <a href="https://mailchimp.com/postcard-opt-out/">Opt out of receiving postcards</a> - 9:21</p><p><a href="http://Sendy.co">Sendy.co</a> - 12:34</p><p>Nabiha Syed's <a href="https://themarkup.org/people/nabiha-syed">bio</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/nabihasyed">Twitter</a> - 14:04</p><p><a href="https://themarkup.org">The Markup</a> - 14:06</p><p><a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/">The Markup's privacy policy</a> - 14:28</p><p><a href="https://themarkup.org/2020/02/25/president-letter-nabiha-syed">Nabiha’s letter</a> - 16:27</p><p>Martijn de Kuijper <a href="https://twitter.com/mdekuijper?">on Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/">Revue</a> - 18:40</p><p><br></p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Nom Wah Tea Parlor is New York Chinatown’s oldest dim sum restaurant. For decades, it served Cantonese dumplings and rolls in the traditional way, from trolleys pushed around the restaurant. When Wilson Tang took over Nom Wah in 2011, he switched from trolleys to menus with pictures and started serving dim sum through dinner. He also opened new locations that broadened Nom Wah’s repertoire beyond dim sum. These were big changes for a restaurant that opened in 1920, but Wilson saw them as measures to secure Nom Wah’s future for its next century in business. </p><p>This episode first aired on The Distance in May 2017.

        <![CDATA[<p>Some of our most famous poets had day jobs: Robert Burns was a tax collector; William Carlos Williams was a doctor; Audre Lorde was a librarian and professor.

        <![CDATA[<p>Listeners may remember that last year Wailin watched ALL of the holiday rom-coms and decided to share them with me on our ill-advised holiday bonus episode. Well, we're bringing it back! This year Wailin made Shaun watch The Knight Before Christmas. It's got magic, chivalry, time travel, wide-legged pants, and an inexplicable post-credit scene. Is the holiday bonus episode still ill-advised? Yes. But, is it fun? Also, yes! Happy Holidays to all of our listeners and we'll be back in 2020 with more stories.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In this anxious era of bullying, teen depression, and school shootings, tech companies are selling software to schools and parents that make big promises about keeping kids secure by monitoring what they say and write online.

The book is a culmination of Ryan's 15+ years working at Basecamp and explains how small teams of designers and programmers can ship great work in six-week cycles. Ryan's book is about product development and software, but many of its ideas around working with the right level of abstraction, embracing constraints, and making smart bets are applicable to other creative pursuits.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>A lot of businesses start as side ventures or hobbies that grow into full-time pursuits. The trick is often in knowing when to quit a comfortable day job to start a new business. We sit down with one of our own at this crossroads. Noah Lorang headed Basecamp's data team for the last eight years, and now he's the sole proprietor of a woodworking shop that makes topographical maps. In this episode, Noah talks about how he made his hobby into a viable business, what Basecamp taught him about entrepreneurship, and what he gets from carving wooden maps that he doesn't get from writing code. Thanks for all the camaraderie, data analysis, and puns, Noah! We'll miss you.</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[<p>A famous guy once said, "Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!" But he was a grifter. In fact, going behind the scenes—whether it's a factory tour or cooking show—can be a valuable experience for both visitors and guides. In this episode, we crash a middle school field trip to the Method soap factory on Chicago's South Side. We also hear from Basecamp's CEO Jason Fried on his YouTube series on making design decisions and from the managing partners of Zingerman's Bakehouse in Ann Arbor, Michigan on why they don't believe in secrets.</p>]]>

      <itunes:summary>The ABC show Shark Tank is irresistible reality programming: Entrepreneurs pitch their businesses to a panel of famous investors and have the potential to make a life-changing deal. But as with any reality show, there's much more to the Shark Tank experience than what gets shown on TV. We talk to three business owners about what it was really like to go on the program—and what happened afterward, when they had to get back to the very real work of building their companies.</itunes:summary>
