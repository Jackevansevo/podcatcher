We then hear a conversation between Sam and <strong>Frank Ostaseski</strong>, founder of the Zen Hospice Project, who shares the valuable lessons he has learned through caring for those in their very last days. Next, we move on to a conversation with <strong>Scott Barry Kaufman</strong>, who explains what it means to pursue a good life by putting a modern spin on Abraham Maslow’s famous hierarchy of needs.</p> <p dir="ltr">Researcher and professor of neuroscience <strong>Roland Griffiths</strong> then details his findings on psychedelic therapies. He and Sam discuss the inexplicable powers of psychedelics in easing the anxiety around death, and how these experiences can potentially help us live fuller lives. Shifting perspectives, we move on by hearing NYU professor <strong>Scott Galloway</strong> explain the social and economic impacts of a society made painfully aware of death by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> <p dir="ltr">We then listen in to author <strong>Oliver Burkeman</strong> as he outlines how the knowledge of our mortality can inform practical time management techniques before addressing an age-old question with physicist <strong>Geoffrey West</strong>: Theoretically, could we engineer humans to live forever?</p> <p dir="ltr">Sam closes this episode with a solo talk, explaining that we needn’t be cynical about the fact that all life must come to an end. Instead, it is the transient nature of life that might be the very thing which makes it beautiful in the first place.<strong><br /></strong></p> <p dir="ltr"> </p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>About the Series</strong></p> <p dir="ltr">Filmmaker Jay Shapiro has produced <strong>The Essential Sam Harris</strong>, a new series of audio documentaries exploring the major topics that Sam has focused on over the course of his career.</p> <p dir="ltr">Each episode weaves together original analysis, critical perspective, and novel thought experiments with some of the most compelling exchanges from the Making Sense archive.

The documentary lays out Tristan’s thesis on how social media is causing the deterioration of both individual and societal welfare. Author and technologist <strong>Jaron Lanier</strong> follows, echoing Tristan’s concerns and shifting the conversation to social media’s unique business model, addressing how perverse incentives reliably produce such detrimental outcomes.</p> <p dir="ltr">We then hear from <strong>Jack Dorsey</strong>, the former CEO of Twitter. Sam and Dorsey’s conversation took place when Dorsey was still working at Twitter, and Sam still had an account. However, the questions they pose—relating to issues of content moderation and corporate transparency—are even more relevant today.</p> <p dir="ltr">Next, psychologist <strong>Jonathan Haidt</strong> presents the alarming findings from his research on the psychological effects of social media, detailing how teenage girls are bearing the brunt of a mental health crisis. </p> <p dir="ltr">Shifting to a more political lens, Sam and <strong>Cass Sunstein</strong> discuss Sunstein’s book, <em>#Republic</em>, and Sunstein addresses one of Sam’s most pressing fears of the last seven years: how social media is warping our opinions on politics. We then narrow down on this issue, with <strong>Zeynep Tufekci</strong> explaining the real-life consequences of social media’s influence on protest movements.</p> <p dir="ltr">Finally, Sam and technology analyst <strong>Nina Schick</strong> dive into one of the most urgent concerns of the AI boom: deepfakes and how they might be weaponized to further pollute and degrade our information landscape.</p> <p dir="ltr"> </p> <p dir="ltr"><strong>About the Series</strong></p> <p dir="ltr">Filmmaker Jay Shapiro has produced <strong>The Essential Sam Harris</strong>, a new series of audio documentaries exploring the major topics that Sam has focused on over the course of his career.</p> <p dir="ltr">Each episode weaves together original analysis, critical perspective, and novel thought experiments with some of the most compelling exchanges from the Making Sense archive.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">In this episode, we examine the timeless question of “free will”: what constitutes it, what is meant by it, what ought to be meant by it, and, of course, whether we have it at all. We start with the neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky who begins to deflate the widely held intuition and assumption of “libertarian free will” by drawing out a mechanistic and determined description of the universe.</p> <p dir="ltr">We then hear from the philosopher who has long been Sam’s intellectual wrestling opponent on this subject, Daniel Dennett. Dennett and Sam spar about definitional and epistemological frameworks of what Dennett insists is “free will,” and what Sam contends could never be.</p> <p dir="ltr">The author and physicist Sean Carroll then engages Sam with more attempts to find a philosophically defensible notion of free will by leaning on the unknowable nature of the universe revealed by quantum mechanics. We then listen in on Sam’s engagement with the mathematician and author Judea Pearl who focuses on matters of causation to tease out a freedom of will.</p> <p dir="ltr">After a historical review of Princess Elizabeth’s famous exchanges with Rene Descartes, we hear from the biologist Jerry Coyne, who firmly agrees with Sam that a deterministic picture of reality leaves absolutely no room for anything like free will.</p> <p dir="ltr">We then hear from the curiously entertaining mind of comedian and producer Ricky Gervais who was thinking about free will while taking a bath when he decided to phone Sam.</p> <p dir="ltr">We conclude with Sam’s own response to concerns that an erasure of free will inevitably result in fatalism, loss of meaning, and passive defeat. Sam insists that the loss of free will actually pushes us in the opposite direction where we begin to see hatred and vengeance as incoherent and start to connect with a deeper and truer sense of genuine compassion.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>About the Series</strong></p> <p>Filmmaker Jay Shapiro has produced <strong>The Essential Sam Harris</strong>, a new series of audio documentaries exploring the major topics that Sam has focused on over the course of his career.</p> <p>Each episode weaves together original analysis, critical perspective, and novel thought experiments with some of the most compelling exchanges from the Making Sense archive.
