We demonstrate the characteristic spatiotemporal response of a DTC for generic initial states. Our work employs a time-reversal protocol that discriminates external decoherence from intrinsic thermalization, and leverages quantum typicality to circumvent the exponential cost of densely sampling the eigenspectrum. In addition, we locate the phase transition out of the DTC with an experimental finite-size analysis. These results establish a scalable approach to study non-equilibrium phases of matter on current quantum processors.</li><li><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/first-time-crystal-built-using-googles-quantum-computer-20210730/" title="First ‚ÄòTime Crystal‚Äô Built Using Google‚Äôs Quantum Computer" rel="nofollow">First ‚ÄòTime Crystal‚Äô Built Using Google‚Äôs Quantum Computer</a></li><li><a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/time-crystals-could-be-the-miracle-quantum-computing-needs" title="Time crystals could be the miracle quantum computing needs" rel="nofollow">Time crystals could be the miracle quantum computing needs</a></li><li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/18/the-end-of-open-source/" title="The end of open source?" rel="nofollow">The end of open source?</a> &mdash; I think the ‚Äúhypocrite commits‚Äù contretemps is symptomatic, on every side, of related trends that threaten the entire extended open-source ecosystem and its users.

We review a Twitter client whose core is functional: managing tweets, syncing timelines to incoming Twitter API data, remembering cursor positions within the tweet list, and rendering tweets to text for display. This functional core is surrounded by a shell of imperative code: it manipulates stdin, stdout, the database, and the network, all based on values produced by the functional core.
