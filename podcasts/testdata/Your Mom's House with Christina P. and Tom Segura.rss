What is going on?!? As usual, Tom gets Charo and Blanca to watch Horrible or Hilarious clips, TikToks, and Fedsmoker videos. Can they handle the trauma? Can Tom and Christina handle the guests? And who won the bet anyway??? Watch and find out!</itunes:subtitle>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year! Tom Segura and Christina P are back with their jeans over their heads and they recap how amazing Cobra Tate was and how broken the mommies were when they first started dating, and we open the show with Daddy Lalagone. Tom realizes he might have a food sensitivity, we analyze a new YMH employee's hair, and talk about the YMH end-of-year dinner. We talk about Mystery the Pick Up Artist and the new Netflix show "Twentysomethings" and how it compares to MTV's Real World back in the day. The moms saw a Charlie Brown Christmas with annoying people in the audience, watch one of the best trash talkers from one of Barstool's Rough N' Rowdy's, and we revisit the gag couple! We get into dad culture, Little Jeans' 5th birthday party, and massage chairs for Tom. We get to see FedSmoker working a case and take a look at Christina's TikTok curations.</p>

With all this vocal fry talk, we start talking about the family that made it popular, the Kardashians, and how insane of transformation Kylie Jenner has had over the years. That leads us to discussing the Travis Scott fiasco as Astro World. Tom then talks about going to sporting events with his dad, Top Dog, who has a real problem with parking/traffic anxiety. We open on a grandpa who gives an update on his brown situation, and we get another sneak peak at the primo googling skills Nadav has to offer as well as an update on airport codes! The mommies discuss how miserable Thanksgiving can be and give tips on the little things you can to make it slightly more bearable. We see the newest British rendition of our favorite garage worker and wonder what kind of revenge you can participate in legally. Eye for an eye? We then unveil a new FedSmoker video (to us) where he seems to be falling head over heels for lady he met at the district attorney's office of a town he's passing through. How would you react if FedSmoker started making a pass at you? We talk about Top Dog saying words wrong for almost no reason, like concierge, Joe Pesci, and Washington. We watch some cool clips of the guy with the pet liger and an old lady who claims to not have a stinky meow. Christina makes the claim that if Tom was single he'd be a "weird alone guy." The Apple store has one of the absolute worst in-store experiences of any company in the world, we see a cool guy withstanding quite a bit of horsepower, and we wrap with Christina's TikTok curations! Happy Thanksgiving and make sure you give thanks to those you're thankful for and try not to eat too much but also make sure you eat enough. Okay have a great week!</p>

The main mommies are celebrating their anniversary and they're trying to figure out how they should celebrate 13 years together. Christina talks about Hungarian drinking culture and her cool dads growing up. We get an update on what Tom and Christina are watching: the new season of Netflix's "You," Game of Thrones and Squid Game! Why are Koreans so good at drama? Let's call Bobby Lee and find out! Christina brings her up her favorite new documentary out of the UK, "Breastfeeding My Boyfriend." We review some Horrible or Hilarious and watch some really cool confrontations in public, which leads to the main mommies to share some of their own crazy confrontations. Christina shares a couple stories she's never shared before (even with Tom) about what a lunatic goth kid she was. We wrap up with a bunch of heart felt TikTok curations by Christina!</p>

We get a wild update on Studio G's comment section, the "Don't Call Me Daddy" guy apparently doesn't like other things, and we dive into Burnt Crystal's puzzling deep love for himself! We find one of Tom's doppelgangers talking about Aegosexuality, a lady in a dope M&M jacket calling out a dude on the street, and over inclusiveness on playgrounds. Also, Tom is learning that he's actually starting to like Las Vegas! Maybe the key is to not be there for 6 nights in a row? We watch footage Ryan Sickler almost ruin a VERY nice racing car! And of course, we review all your club banger remixes of Cutter The Killer Clown's vocal track! We then wrap up with a batch of Christina's Toks that are definitely more uplifting than last week's batch!</p>

This week on your Mom&apos;s House Podcast with Christina P. and #GloveComic Tom Segura, we test Christina&apos;s fear of vomit a bit more, which leads to her retaliating with one of her instant-classic TikToks! This then leads to a VERY heated debate how this cool guy is making some certain sounds. We get a wild update on Studio G&apos;s comment section, the &quot;Don&apos;t Call Me Daddy&quot; guy apparently doesn&apos;t like other things, and we dive into Burnt Crystal&apos;s puzzling deep love for himself! We find one of Tom&apos;s doppelgangers talking about Aegosexuality, a lady in a dope M&amp;M jacket calling out a dude on the street, and over inclusiveness on playgrounds. Also, Tom is learning that he&apos;s actually starting to like Las Vegas! Maybe the key is to not be there for 6 nights in a row? We watch footage Ryan Sickler almost ruin a VERY nice racing car! And of course, we review all your club banger remixes of Cutter The Killer Clown&apos;s vocal track! We then wrap up with a batch of Christina&apos;s Toks that are definitely more uplifting than last week&apos;s batch!</itunes:subtitle>

They also watch videos of a cool swastika guy, an AEW commentator flubbing Bert Kreischer's name once again, a fan parody of Elliott - the video message cool guy, and they pay tribute to the late, great Larry King by rewatching his iconic "Saka Souffle" clips. They read follow-up emails from the paramedic-panty saleswoman a Fans Only creator, and an inquiry about Christine dating The King. This prompts a big announcement from Mommy Tina.

Jean and Jean show her how Ariel Helwani pronounces it, as well as a Brazilian politician who got caught sniffing panties, our favorite boot licker, and John McAfee licking his shoe.

Tom Segura and Christina P kick off this episode of YMH with a video of a woman who really needs to brown. They discuss the latest instance of Nadav doing bad, Bert Kreischer's kool-aid intake, how often Dr. Drew gets milked, and their recent trips to the dermatologist. They watch a vintage English commercial for a questionably-named product, a very strange Instagram live-stream, a dude eating nails, a cool talking about his success with women, an English lesson on slang words, a cool guy who collects mousepads, and a follow-up from everyone's least favorite bearded lady. The main mommies also play a game where they watch some of the most intense videos on the internet, which naturally leads them to call Dr. Drew to discuss the potential health risks of eating brown.</p> <p>Russell Peters is a stand-up comedian, actor, and producer. Russell sits down with Jean & Jean to talk about Jiu Jitsu, rolling with Joe Rogan, partying at Eddie Murphy's house, hip-hop, and the controversy around Hank Azaria playing Apu on The Simpsons. They share the murder play video with Russell, as well as a DIY video on how to make jewelry out of human teeth, a cool girl rapping, and some of Mommy Tina's TikTok curations.</p> <p>Pierce Paris is a very strong performer and social-media creator. He joins the mommies on the couch to discuss his iconic video that Tim and Crystal have been obsessed with. He discusses how he prepared for that video, his other Twitter stunts, how he started a viral challenge, and eating bear scrum. He also gives us a walk-through his prep process and reviews RPC's premium content.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>SPONSORS: - Get 20% Off and Free Shipping with the code MOM20 at Manscaped.com - Use promo code "mom" for 10% off your first order at Brooklinen.com</p> <p>Welcome to Lucifer’s Lair with your hot hosts Tom Segura and Christina P. The main mommies start this episode off by posing a very pressing question: Is B stuff more tiring than V stuff? Jean and Jean then take a look at a new rendition of the Bee Gees classic “Stayin’ Alive.” Tom gives us a dental update, and Christina discusses her recent smurfday and the amazing cake Tom got her. They watch a video of a cool guy vaping, and an equally cool Donald Trump campaign video shot on an iPhone. They transition into discussing the recent Chris D’Elia news, as well as Joey Diaz and the culture of comedy clubs as a whole. They wrap up the segment by watching two more cool videos. In one a guy is able to excrete his beanbag out of his bottom; the other is just a cool lady going crazy on some paramedics.</p> <p>Taylor Tomlinson is a stand-up comedian, and host of the "Self-Helpless" and "This Is Important to Me" podcasts. She talks to Todd and Crystal about starting stand-up as a teenager, her religious parents, the passing of her mom, and her new Netflix special “Quarter-Life Crisis.” The discussion about Taylor’s parents leads Tom to call Top Dog and Charo and ask him their burning question about the B vs. the V. Top Dog insists that back-door is much more tiring. Charo is horrified. The Jeans bring Taylor up to speed on everyone’s favorite psychopath: Garth Brooks, as well as some other cool guys and gals. Tom discusses the brokest he’s ever been, and Christina discusses her Cream of Brown experience. They wrap up by watching some of CP’s TikTok curations, a lane of the Tok that Taylor didn’t know existed.</p>

We discuss the new move of HoneyDew to it’s own channel and then get into some of the most disgusting YMH content we may have ever seen. This episode leaves everyone in a heap of tears and nausea. It is not to be missed. Again, very tough to describe in words what was just witnessed. Good luck.</p>

What kind of name is Braden? Plus, while we celebrate our NRE, we discuss what porn scenarios we would consider. The scenario presented by Josh Potter may become a reality as he is an experienced sex worker with celebrity clientele. While in Vegas, Tom and Josh ran into Corey Taylor from Slipknot, who has partaken in Josh’s Cameo Sex Work. As if that wasn’t enough, a new episode of everyones favorite show has just dropped. Bert Kreischer is a comedian and podcaster who’s Netflix Special “Hey Big Boy” is available now. While out on the Berty Boy world tour, Bert has taken some liberties. Bert has also been getting into OnlyFans in the road, so the Mommies try to convince him to subscribe to a certain account. Plus, Bert is mad at LeeAnn and gets her on the phone to discuss things. And, a new challenge/bet is decided upon.

      <title>541 - Moshe Kasher &amp; Natasha Leggero &amp; Creators of HBO&apos;s McMillions - Your Mom&apos;s House with Christina P and Tom Segura</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p> We got a special one for you today, mommy! We start off with just the main mommies and we get through A LOT! The cool girl raving about NRE has a boyfriend who heard YMH talking about them, and turns out, he likes it a lot! Also, Tom has officially decided he's done with his wack Adidas phase, and is back on the Nike train! Then, Christina reveals a super hot dream she had about Tom. Do you dream about your significant other? We then find a cool guy who wishes he had a girlfriend who let him... do certain things. He likes that he likes that he liiiiiiikes THAT! And what better way to pay tribute to FedSmoker than to keep feathering videos from his very deep vault? This time he's hanging out with Native Americans!</p> <p> Then, we got Moshe Kasher and Natasha Leggero coming in to Studio Jeans! We Moshe loves to argue with people on the internet almost as much as he loves Burning Man! We run them through a BUNCH of cool guys, including a clip from Cobra Tate about how faithfulness is a one way street! So cool! We debut the next episode of Pissspots to Moshe and Natasha, and they're certain HBO will pick it up for a full run!</p> <p> Speaking of HBO, we have Brian Lazarte and James Lee Hernandez, the creators/directors of HBO's McMillions, joining us! The docuseries reveals how McDonald's Monopoly game was rigged for a LONG time by the mob. They tell us all about how they got involved in the project and what it's like to work with Mark Wah-Wah-Wahlburg. It also turns out that Brian is Tom's cousin, so they reminisce what it was like to grow up with each other.</p>

Judd Apatow is a comedian who has become a mogul as a television/film producer and writer. He's most recently been working on the Pete Davidson movie and gives us some stories from the set, including Bill Burr stories. After reminiscing about Judd's life for a bit, we show Judd some audition tapes from our Cool Guys to see which one he would cast in a film. We also play a few rounds of Horrible or Hilarious to see what Judd thinks.</p> <p>Brian Simpson is a hilarious comedian who you may have seen at The World Famous Comedy Store or on Lights Out with David Spade. Brian grew up in foster care and found himself getting into a lot of trouble, including shooting a person (on accident.) Brian then found his way into the Marine Corps which turned things around. Brian also helps us get to the bottom of SooWoo and gives some advice to listeners who have recently sent in emails to Tom and Christina.</p>

The topic of NYC's new found "woke-ness" is brought up as Jay had an incident at The Comedy Cellar. Big Jay and Dan Soder often watch clips on their show The Bonfire, including Good Morning Julia, so the Mommies get his insight into it and let him in on what they've found. Big Jay and Dan also reviewed Charro's video, so we relive that with him as well. Robert Paul Champagne is brought to Jay's attention and Jay recounts a story from back in the day when Josh Potter was driving him around for a weekend. Big Jay also tells The Mommies about Skankfest and the Louis CK appearance, and the murder of his manager and owner of The Stand Comedy Club in NYC, Dave Kimowitz.</p>

      <title>498-Sera Gamble &amp; Heath Evans-Your Mom&apos;s House with Christina P and Tom Segura</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>HELLO, MOMMIES! We're still reeling from all of the Robert Paul Champagne memes and content you've made for us. It's been overwhelming in all the best ways. Tom and Christina review some of the reaction to RPC coming on the show the last two weeks. Have you ever had a fart bully in your life? Is Emma Stone hot enough to be cast as Ryan Gosling's love interest? The Mommies debate.  Next, Josh Potter is on the couch to wet our whistle for our first guest, Sera Gamble. Josh tells some wild stories of cyber stalking and is presented with a proposition by the Main Mommies.  After hearing about some cyber stalking tales, Sera Gamble (writer and creator of "YOU") is in studio to give her insight into cyber stalking and how "Joe" in YOU has implemented social media to become a stalker. Sera also gives us some teases about the upcoming season of YOU and the story of getting the show out to the masses.  Next, he played for the Seattle Seahawks, New Orleans Saints, Miami Dolphins and The New England Patriots, but more importantly, he played against Tom in High School. It's fullback and broadcaster Heath Evans! Heath and Tom reminisce about their time in high school and the small differences in their athletic career, plus Heath has some great stories from his NFL days about Bill Belichick, Tom Brady and Randy Moss.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Listen, Mommies. It will be tough to top last weeks monumental achievement in podcasting, but we are going to "Try It Out." This week we meet a man who Duncan Trussell exposed Dr. Drew to recently. He's definitely a Cool Guy. Tom celebrated his 40th birthday, what did Christina get him?? A chain or a private jet?? Doug Mellard got ALL of us the gift of a weird Happy Birthday serenade. Christina had a shower revelation that even bewilders the Cockroach himself. Since we had Robert Paul Champagne on the Podcast he has been live streaming quite a bit. We review some of his recent posts and then give him another call. That's right, Robert Paul Champagne is BACK!</p> <p> Also, the legendary Dane Cook is on the couch ready to "Try It Out." Dane and the Mommies reminisce about old times at Dublin's in Hollywood and Dane goes through the roller coaster that he experienced while reaching heights of fame few ever get to know. He goes in depth about his brother stealing from him and his reasoning for improvising his special that was taped in Madison Square Garden "Rough Around The Edges." Also, Dane experiences a member of "The Cool Girl Club" and "Horrible or Hilarious."</p> <p>Next in the Mommydome is comedian Ryan Stout. Ryan can't smell anything, he literally has no sense of smell. The Mommies ask Ryan all the important questions involved with not being able to smell a fart or otherwise. Ryan brings up the "Maplethorpe Exhibit" and if you know what that is, you know what that is...  Plus Mommy Tina thinks airpods looks like something coming out of your ears. Do you know what she thinks it looks like???</p> <p>Don't forget to get Ryan's new album, <em>Man in the Suit.</em></p> <p>NOTE: Every guest of YOUR MOM'S HOUSE Podcast is INVITATION ONLY. No guest is welcome with out a formal invitation from The Mommies. Dane Cook, Ryan Stout and Robert Paul Champagne have all been certified, invited guests. Thank you.</p>

He gives us some real insight into some super neato musicians and the super cool people who support them. R. Kelly being exhibit A.  THEN, one of our all time faves - Wheeler Walker Jr. returns. He&apos;s married with a baby now, but will forever be the poon king to us. His voice is angelic but it&apos;s the way Ol&apos; Wheeler doesn&apos;t hold back on anything that really wins over our hearts.  NEXT, legendary Oakland rapper Too $hort is in the building with his Blow The Whistle co-host Kevin Blatt. Tommy nerds out on how Get In Where You Fit In was his high school theme music and how embarrassed he was to find out he quoted it incorrectly in his last special, Disgraceful.  Blatt fills us in on the world of sex tapes - how to sell them and more importantly - how to make them go away.  Epic episode, Jean. </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>What kind of dude brings a dead raccoon into a restaurant? A cool SF dude. We have the tape to prove it.  Plus, we heard that a fake orgasm can be detected if you really slow down the audio on it. Was Uncle Terry faking it? Here&apos;s a test.  All time favorite derelict Yoshi is back! He talks about more medical experimenting, prostitutes and uses his astute ear to guess which porn performer is screaming into his headphones. Be sure to listen to The Last Days of August available now on audible.  AND our original OG son, Redban stops by and we catch up on his ridiculous life. He&apos;s our big boy now and he also tells us probably the most disgusting story of all time, which is really saying something on this podcast. Also, Redban would go gay for about $500K. Not a bad deal.   </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Nothing quite like a real dad losing his mind over a mediocre joke. You should know if you listen to this show that Tommy was raised by a hardcore dad boner who can barely finish a sentence if he&apos;s struck by his own &quot;hilarious&quot; thought. We may have found some competition for Top Dog this week. PLUS, if you are a lady or a ZER do you want a man/zim to treat you like the perfect little princess that you are? Gross. And why do all those girls talk like that, Britttany?!? We are joined in studio by the great Brad Williams a hilarious comic and friend of ours. We break down some hooker sales pitches, guess what FGT RTD means, read your emails and hear Brad&apos;s great stories about the lamest stuff he hears from people about being a little person.  This one is a certified denim classic!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>There&apos;s a wise, older Asian man that can have an orgasm without ejactulating and every time he shakes from within his prostate it&apos;s like watching a parade: pure, unadulterated joy.  Aside from that this episode is full of fun. We have a man that uses ALL the Big Words he can think of, PLUS a job orientation that rivals the infamous Let&apos;s Get Social song.  We have a follow up on Shaq&apos;s biggest &quot;toe&quot; and a big announcement for Tommy&apos;s fall shows. Plus, don&apos;t forget to MAKE FITNESS in our new official Fitness tank.  (Imagine the sound of the Asian man shaking from the inside here). </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>As perhaps the leading non-binary couple in the podcast comedy world today we are thrilled to bring you this aspect of the wonder from the perspective of our obtuse reality. Hope that was clear.  Sometimes when you are making a brown someone will crawl under the stall to see if you are indeed browning. What would you do in that situation?  The Mommies saw another horrible movie. Hope you get to have a night ruined by it as well.  Plus another guy had vocal fry and it wasn&apos;t even the worst part of his personality. He also liked to....kill and eat people. Can you guess who? This episode is full of such a good time we HAD to find some boring audio to dull it down. Hope it&apos;s boring enough for you. </itunes:summary>

      <title>177-Your Mom&apos;s House with Christina Pazsitzky and Tom Segura</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>You can survive on just air and sunlight and nothing else, but you'll die pretty quickly also. Tina makes a compelling argument for why she feels so strongly about being the MAIN Mommy - she HAS been farting on the show and put TURDS on the ground. Chuck Woolery listens to our show. We think. And he feels badly about being so GREEZY. Do you return the shopping cart to the store or do you leave it by your car like a jerkface? We revisit yelling when you're angry - it doesn't define who you are. It's human emotion, you f***ing f**k. Tina talks about her past City Connection love and Tom shares his brief experience with all that PWESSHAH! </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you don't like the way things are done at your school, do what our South African friend does and bring a whip. Make it a quick class, very quick class! The mommies recap their tour of the South and all the calories that came with it. Cheese and PISSA and wings. So, so, so many wings. We share the Ricky Schroder/Webster story from JRE as we still can't enough of that cute, little, black son of a bitch. Chuck Woolery has a pretty crazy twitter account. We read some of it and then play some of the classics from Love Connection. My goodness do we love that show. Put 2 and 2 in your butt. Plus we play audio of a man who is disappointed in his prostitute. It's horrifying!</p>

We also take more calls from our listeners about Love! Can you feel that? That&apos;s your jeans getting TIGHTER! </itunes:subtitle>

      <title>Brody Stevens-Episode 90-Your Mom&apos;s House with Christina Pazsitzky and Tom Segura</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>YES! Good things come to those who wait and we can't think of anything better than having STEVEN BRODY STEVENS in the Mommy Dome. They just don't make jeans high enough to express our excitement. Brody is his usual POSITIVE self and opens up in a way that will only make you love him more. We talk the Valley, audience warm-up 101, positive energy/positive language, some sports, Daisy the dog, mental health, and much more. If you're not screaming "818 til I die!" by the end of this episode then you needs some meds of your own! </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Some people make your P***y dry! Who does that in your life? Now let them know. Good job. We talk about regrets in life, how awful some audience members can be, how awesome others are, but the big news is that our sushi server who berates for ordering too much is caught on tape giving us the biz! The real scoop is that we really don't order that much, this woman just hates us and everyone who orders more than 4 bites. Then we share what is perhaps the most infuriating 60 Minutes piece we have ever seen -at least in the consumer market genre-and we want our mommies to know the truth. Sunglasses are a racket! Theo fills it up! Oh My GOD!</p>

We open up to you about our past week - a tough one for us and the little doggie we adopted, Theo (Dr. Huxtable's son). Thankfully, he's still with us. We also get Jeansy with Angel from Angel's Fellatio Secrets - yes, that one. She gives a great interview and gives tips on getting ding dongs down, painless anal and more. Plus, certain cultures behave in very specific, sometimes gross ways. Are you one of those? Do you know people who are? Share with us. We love her!</p>

Did you ever go hoggin' back in your day? Gaping butthole photos? We cover that for you. Sometimes violence in movies and television is hysterical and we kind of disagree on that. Weigh in with your opinion, won't you? Did you know that Webster was a huge pop star in Japan? We have the never award winning audio! His voice is annoying and adorable at the same time! Coca-Cola calls its customers RETARDS and we have the proof (or was it retardED). We give you the FULL Willie Rack Em audio and Tommy hits on a sushi waitress. Remember, there's only 1 Mommy.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Musical mommies are abundant! You sent in your tunes and we play some of them, but really, we have to admit that WE are the musical masters. Tina dropped "Animal Song" last time and this time Tommy brings the heat with "Butthole Song". Grammy's are A'callin'. Tight jeans are great, but not if they're low. You gotta pull em up! We're happy to announce that our bonus episode made it to iTunes and you made us #2! When you're Puerto Rican you're just Puerto Rican, especially if it's the Puerto Rican Day Parade! Ay Papi - Duro! The mommies are going on vacation thanks to Tina's pops, plus Candy Crush is DEE-LI-CIOUS. 7AM is a little early to flirt, ya'll!, plus we found a horrible woman who recorded herself being horrible. Keep it Jeansy!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Tina and Tommy have their jeans so high you can barely see their eyes on this one! They get warmed up with prison talk and how they better get ready to eat some box and throw some punches to survive (if they get locked up). Tommy reveals that someone from his past is Filling Up and Sealing Shut one of his All-Time Faves! In our Real Talk segment we explore the sad truth that some reality tv is anything but real, especially TLC's hit show Breaking Amish. A toilet paper test FINALLY reveals who is using the most TP in the mommydome and a MOMMY JEANS EXCLUSIVE - Maria, who TALKS LIKE THAT, is finally on the show in full Maria-Mode. Plus a review of Tom's new album from his mother. </p>

      <title>Episode 72-Jenny Mollen-Your Mom&apos;s House with Christina Pazsitzky and Tom Segura</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>TMZ ain't got S**T on your mommies! We welcome actress, tweeter, and hilarious writer Jenny Mollen aka @jennyandteets into the Mommydome for lots of laughs and general tomfoolery. Real Talk gets really real with more of Big Ang and we get the inside scoop on Jenny's favorite show, The Bachelorette, complete with tons of ridiculous audio. Most noteworthy of all we play Dick Detectives with Jenny and who is the suspect? Her husband - Jason Biggs! (HINT: It isn't small). If that's not enough for you then you go away! Enjoy!</p>
<p>PS. The voice that pops in a few times is Jenny's very hungover friend, Leslie. </p>

Plus we visit the new Weiner scandal and read some of his hysterical (creepy) texts and NEW Fill Her Up/Seal Her Shut and for the first time ever we take YOUR calls. Sorry for the call waiting beeps.

Your baby's grandfather AKA The Dutch Sommelier AKA The Full Charge, Matt Fulchiron is back from Puerto Rico and it's like he never left!

      <title>Brandt Tobler-147-Your Mom&apos;s House with Christina Pazsitzky and Tom Segura</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Mayday Mayday Mayday! Mommy Down! That's right, this episode there's only 1 mommy, 1 pair of lower, looser jeans. It's sad, but don't worry. Tina mommy will end up being okay. She's resting and getting new denim to make her feel better. This episode we have the very funny, unpredictable and completely outrageous, Brandt Tobler in the Dome. Nicky Santoro is a more welcome sight in casinos than Tobler. If you think I'm kidding, just listen. Tobler's stories are so incredible you genuinely feel like he's telling you fiction - but he isn't. He's done more and seen more than most people see in 10 lifetimes. It's always great to get a comic in the building with all kinds of crazy stories to tell. Buckle up on this one. We guarantee you'll be wanting to hear more from Tobler. Don't forget to follow him -- @brandtTobler </p>

Comedian, actor and all around good buddy Matt sits down with us as we talk about how great it would be to have Tony Soprano as a father. After all, we are all White, which is a huge plus these days. We go DEEP with Matt as we share and discuss revelations about ourselves and how we discover truths and act on them (For Reals, dawg). Beware of PSYCHOS! They're not just characters on TV. They're everywhere and you probably know a few. Shia LaBeouf, pay attention here. We are back exploring the musical talents of the oozing-with-talent mega movie stars of the last 20 years. Eddie Murphy, Don Johnson and Russell Crowe all, uh, sing? The episode is the DOGS T*TS! (There's even a Lorenzo Lamas story)</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Ohhhh jeans, your jeans, how bright they are to have more jeans like mine! If you make it to 100 years of age chances are you'll wish you had some d**k or p***y, but will you have the courage to say that? One 100 year old lady made it clear that that's the only thing on her mind and it's glorious! Lucky for all of us the great TOP DOG joins us again and this may be his ALL-TIME greatest appearance. What begins as a discussion about public restrooms and which airports are the best to dump in soon becomes a discussion about the effects of war - and the thrill of killing the enemy. Top Dog talks about the bond formed from being in combat with one's fellow man and the joy of finding another man's head blown off. It's amazing to the 10th degree! No Loose Jeans Allowed!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill "Gingery" Burr enters the mommy dome for a lengthy, laugh-filled conversation. A true sportsman, Burr talked football with Tom until Christina started snoring. The three talked comedy - mainly Burr's stories of hanging at the Comedy Cellar in NYC and everything that was great (and terrifying) about being around the late Patrice O'Neal. We talk about shit-talking online and when people share too much -in person and on Facebook. Bill gets fired up about getting bodyscanned at the airport and why you should never use your debit card. Mike Singletary, Would You Rather, Bears and more! What type of denim are you wearing today?! </p>

      <title>Episode 61 Your Mom&apos;s House with Christina Pazsitzky and Tom Segura</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Well if you aren't my mommy then who are you? Tommy spent the weekend in NYC with his close celebrity friends (no big deal) and shares his love for the great big ol' apple (is that the expression?). We revisit Tom's mom's obsession with everything Wu-Tang. Christina fixates on why she routinely tortures herself with caffeine and toothbrushes, while Tom does the same with his fingers. We discuss our desire for a psychologist to analyze comedic podcasters, play some of our new faves in REAL TALK, and finally introduce you to Christina's father with some primo audio! Be Her!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Chang chong ping pong! Guess who's back? It's the great Yoshi! This is by far one of the craziest episodes we've ever done. Yoshi goes deep.

There's no way we can describe everything we talk about, but here are some key words: Porn, fighting, death, fleeing, kids, blood, hookers. What do you think? Yeah, I thought so. Come back in 2 days for part 2, Geisha Jeans!</p>

      <title>157-Your Mom&apos;s House with Christina Pazsitzky and Tom Segura</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you have a family that is overflowing with talent then you need to have a vision for the journey so the spirits can come together and be a business. That's a quote. Sort of. Listen to how the Will and Jada Smith's run their household. Be sure to have a bucket nearby - you might get sick. Some actors are also too talented for their own good, like Jared Leto or a pile of horse sh*t. Egos of this magnitude are fascinating. Ladies, if it's that time of the month, don't be selfish. Offer your "other" entry so that a man doesn't suffer just because you're "bleeding." Theo talks smack to Tina and a whole lot more! Jeans Forever!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Ian Bagg is now a U.S. citizen and we treat him accordingly. We discuss what's permissable to say as a comedian and whether comics should be held accountable for what they say on stage and the culture of today's clubs in general. Also, Indian people will rape you - in large numbers. Loud people on planes should be kicked off and fully investigated by our government, people who dress terribly have something in common with Michael Jordan and nothing in common Liberace - our HERO! Plus the Top Dog and Charo ep is now on sale! When you're Puerto Rican you're Puerto Rican</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What's your parenting style? Shame, anger, guilt, all 3? Good for you. We welcome your form of abuse into our home. All forms of entertainment including sports are simply distractions. What's important is rarely discussed by the majority. We get into the thick of it and question why. Why do we ignore what's really significant? After this prolific philosophical question we soon have Top Dog on the phone to talk about poop. Tommy introduces TD to the Bristol Stool Scale and the results are magnificent. What was Da Vinci's reaction when he discovered a paintbrush? Very similar. If you ever have a problem with your food be sure to call 911. That's what it's for. </p>

The man who's farts can be heard around the world made some of you scream with laughter while other cried is complete disgust. We read your feedback as we prepare to do live shows in Texas. Learning isn't supposed to be fun. Stop being stupid, just learn like an adult. By reading. Books. Ladies, don't feel bad if your hangers flap around in the wind. Us guys still want whatever you got.

      <title>Tony Hinchcliffe-105-Your Mom&apos;s House with Christina Pazsitzky and Tom Segura</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The episode will teach you the two greatest things in life, "Never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut." If that sounds like some real mafioso stuff, well, it is. This has to be one of the most fascinating episodes we've ever done. Our guest is comedian, writer and son of mobster, Tony Hinchcliffe AKA Tony Marsco AKA Tony Nickels AKA Tony Tip Toes. You'd never guess it but Hinchcliffe grew up the son of a mob boss father and bookie mother. HOW DO YOU NEED MORE INFO AFTER THAT?? We also revisit Angel and more of her secrets, but mostly this episode is everything Organized Crime. Put on your pressed jeans for this one.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Matt Braunger is one of our tallest and most bestestest friends and we are more than smiling so hard that he's back, that our teeth might fall out of our heads. We talk about music, hip-hop lyrics, embracing what you like instead of saying what you hate! How about THAT? Yeah, we're adults. We talk weirdos at shows and ones that offer you their wives! HELLO! Matt talks about his recent trip to Korea and all the brown that followed. Matt reviews ANIMAL SONG and more. It's such a good episode you'll probably order new jeans online while you're listening. </p>

If you haven't yet figured it out this episode is very much NSFW or for those of you that listen on speakers in public places - this audio will definitely lead to you getting fired or losing friends/family. If every one knows that you're bald then when you wear a wig we all know that's not your hair, Jason Alexander. Pretty girls will always be annoying if you allow them to be. When you ignore the stupidity that oozes out of their mouths you're helping them become more interesting. This is the secret to life. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Oh, Canada. Oh, Canada, you need more lyrics in your national anthem and PLEASE train your singers when they pipe out OUR national anthem or perhaps they will be decapitated on the ice? Maybe. Hit the high notes, sister! We recap a magical weekend in Portland and Seattle, a weekend that was all about that deep blue color that pumps thru our veins - denim. A special phone call with Joey Diaz unlike any other call you could ever imagine. Diaz, as always, inspires, bewilders, and makes us laugh until we nearly stroke out. BREAKING: We get the inside scoop on the fiasco that was Brendon Walsh's nearly-guest hosting The Tonight Show while Jay Leno was sick. All we can say is, Thank God Jay felt better before Walsh covered for him. </p>

      <title>The Winnipeg Bombing-172-Your Mom&apos;s House with Christina Pazsitzky and Tom Segura</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There are good shows as a comedian and there are great shows. Sometimes there are bad shows and then there's this. In Tommy's near 12 year career as a stand up he has had the full spectrum of shows, but nothing quite compares to the Massacre in Manitoba. In this episode we fully examine everything that went into a show going so far off the rails that Tommy had to leave before it was over. We play highlights - if you can call them that - and talk about some of our worst shows ever. In keeping with the Canadian theme we revisit Rob Ford and update you on what he's been eating. </p>

Some airlines will stop treating you like children and let you now use your electronic devices during take off and landing - oh, right. You never turned them off to begin with.

      <title>180-Your Mom&apos;s House with Christina Pazsitzky and Tom Segura</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>OMG, you guys. We got such a huge response to the Maria call that we revisit it and all its hilarity. According to Christina, Tommy doesn't show much excitement about anything. Well, that is, until you propose that he might be able to get away with murder! That's a fun scenario that we break down because everyone wants to do it, don't you agree? Tina and Tommy also talk about going back in time and what they would do if they could take each other on a first date knowing what they know now. As you can imagine, it's quite romantic. We read a listener email that asks the HARD questions. Do we answer them? Oh yeah. What would you do if you had 6 months to live? We do it real big. Tina has opened a savings account to go to space. Please donate. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The mommies can't add. We know words and we know sounds and we know that catsfish and bass loves frogs cause we're smart. We knows what's to use! But math - no thank you! Tommy is smarter than Tina, but Tina has a big heart. Tommy also has a special gift - he knows from simply glancing at a woman if she is DTF. He knows who is a waste of time and who has jeans that are easy to take off. We go back for Sushi from the lady who enjoys shaming us, but this time we show her who will apply more pressure (pwessha). We have a Brown Talk segment that truly breaks it down. Plus Dental Updates and more!</p>

      <title>Episode 60 Your Mom&apos;s House with Christina Pazsitzky and Tom Segura</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The duo is back in the mommydome! Gastrointestinal issues are the launching point for this episode and this time it's serious (brown talk). They discuss last week's live show and all that came with it. Tom and Christina highly recommend taking a train to wherever you may be headed. They share their observations about the Gaslamp district in San Diego and how finding a TGI Friday's can sometimes be a good thing. Everything bothers older people is a topic that touches both deeply, and a very special Fill Her Up/Seal Her Shut debuts.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>OH MAH GAWD SERIOUSLLAAHHHH, Maria is here, you guys! This is a dream come true in the Mommy Dome. Tommy's older sister and Starbucks' Enemy Number One, Maria stops by for a chat and she jumps in like a pro. She shares more contempt for more employees of new company's while also getting down with some of the tried and true segments of YMH. Get to know the Maria you thought you knew (she knows Tom's voice) while hearing about her military exploits, how she deals with Top Dog, and conceding that Jane does in fact have better teeth and vision. It's so fun when your jeans get even tighter cause you just washed 'em!</p>

Charles Ramsey tells it like it is and that's why we can't get enough of him on YMH. While some are quick to point out he isn't the most media saavy man on the planet, we're here to tell you that is precisely why he is so awesome. He is SO awesome that we hope he comes to see Christina in Cleveland this week - lets make it happen. We went back to Snooshi and we ate WHATEVER WE WANTED, Buns tells you how dope T Dot was and it gets real jeansy when The D**K Detectives go after their next case - Matt Fulchiron! All that plus prostitutes and more! Cut holes into your denim!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>You know what I'm sayin? We like to say it first! Sometimes you put your peepee in a scary place and you don't die - we celebrate that. We hear from a black man who isn't hung like a black man. If someone has had sex with 100 plus people do you count them out as marriage material? The Mommies don't agree. Oprah doesn't front. She's actually Mad Cool. I wish directors would act more like I wish actors would sing more. STOP PUTTING YOURSELF IN MOVIES. Is Alec Baldwin a homophobe because he said something bad when he was mad? Do simple words mean more than intent and action? Don't be a #$%^*. A break thru BROWN TALK and more!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>These aren't your dad's jeans! We tell you that aging means that your accomplishments aren't noteworthy - deal with it! If your newly single, the secret is New D**K and New P***Y. Do you know what the worst intros possible are that exist for us as comedians? Don't worry, we'll recreate them for you. Do you need healing of any kind? Does your back or arm or teeth or feeling hurt? Please stare into the eyes of Braco. Don't talk to him or ask any quesions. Just look at him and feel his essence (and buy his jewelry) and you may be healed. If you can't stand staring consider going to see Crapzo - he won't talk but will jizz on you. Plus Fill Her/Seal Her Shut completely dead style! Put some jeans on layaway. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Put on your lovey jeans, Jeans! It's ValenTIMES day! Today is the official kissy face day in America according to the US constitution Abraham Lincoln and Benjamin Franklin were kissing in a bathtub when George Washington walked in on them and said "Less war, more Kissies, guys." And that's how that happened. This episode covers the jammy jams that are now all about droppin some D in warm, welcoming place (the essence of Valentimes). The Mommy's also try to make a love connection happen in the real world! Comedian and friend Erik Lundy is looking for love and we want to help him. Listen and perhaps, PERHAPS, love him! Run a bath, light some candles and get ready for the love from both of us! </p>

One of the greatest documentary films of all time that is near and dear to our hearts, Stevie, is discussed, complete with incredible audio selects. Watch out for Snake! Stevie, whom the documentary is based on is also a piece of shit. This leads us to a conversation about molestors including former PSU coach, Jerry Sandusky.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What happens when a man that's been around sits down with you and just...starts talking? You open up in ways you never thought you would. This episode had some sort of plan before we started, but Greg Fitzsimmons AKA Fitzdog dropped a dime on us and we ended up being more vulnerable than ever before. This episode is your mommy's without their jeans - your naked mommies. Fitz really is hilarious and a fantastic guest/interviewer. This is one of the most engaging and interesting conversations we've ever had in the "Dome." Enjoy!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Do you smoke crack? Exactly. Canadian jeans step up and do the dew! We love audio that paints a picture. We have some that straight up blasts your face! If you can squirt, let us know how you do it - for realsies. We rank chocolate candy treats and Tina ranks Almond Joy at the BOTTOM! Do you think she's a communist???? Bunz strongly disagrees. Which country makes the best, most delicious chocolate treats? A serious debate takes place. Does size matter? Yes. For sure. Definitely. Your small penis size is bad luck and not your fault and now there's a movie about that. Tom used to be a doctor. Tina talks about T.O. - yes the former Pro Bowl receiver was on an Oprah-like show. Abusive dads often create great athletes/accomplished men - so maybe not a bad idea to beat your kids? Trashy panties smell good. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>ATTENTION all Jeans, we hope you can hear this! Sorry for the trouble with 107 - it wasn't me! (It wasn't Blueban either). Can a loving mommy have more than one pair of jeans? Jada-Pinkett Smith sure makes it sound like Big Willie Style has been doing his best to drop his D in as many extras as possible. We discuss whether or not we could tolerate Tina with all her Ricans and Tommy smashin road box. Tina updates you on her Russian teeth fillings and we bring back Fill Her Up/Seal Her Shut with some modern day broads up against some throw-back ho's. Theo gets back on the mic and Would You Rather is at its best - real homerun scenarios. Jeans Out!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Happy HatesGiving, MOMMY! As is tradition on this show we'll do our best to offend you for the holiday! </p>
<p>Do you have an incurable neurological disorder? Is English not your first language? Do you not look like us? Do you live somewhere that isn't Los Angeles? Hopefully we hit you below the belt!</p>
<p>The Persian Lady who has left Tina countless messages about the desert and sharia laws has, you guessed it, left MORE messages. What the hell is she saying in Farsi?!?</p>
<p>We encourage you to EAT WHAT YOU WANT for Thanksgiving. Is turkey not your thing? Push back against the man and get a steak or a hot dog - whatever you desire, Mommy.</p>
<p>PLUS we have audio of TINA SNORING (LOUDLY), a crazy escort talks about her "job" AND a HUGE announcement that involves Tommy and one of the greatest rappers of ALL TIME. </p>

      <itunes:summary>When you smell those jeans is when I feel the strongest. Those and of course grey sweatpants. 
We missed you and this episode is almost a day late, but we promise that it&apos;s worth it. Of course there&apos;s porn being played in various California Target stores, but of course the Mommies have a good plan on how this rascal can up his game. 
Plus more fun sex audio and rap songs that are simply delightful. 
But we know why you&apos;re here this week and quite simply, yes, we have Diego AKA Thursday Lane and people are eager to help him smell man butt for hours and hours. It&apos;s all in these Jeans.

<p>Chuck Woolery has a NEW endorsement. Is it GREEZY? Not really, but it sure does cost a lot. Can you imagine being married to Steven Seagal. If you can you probably just passed out.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Jeans, Jeans, Jeans - here&apos;s a riddle for you: What do you call a lesbian that doesn&apos;t eat p***y? We don&apos;t know either, but some lady is pretty worked up about it.
The Mommies have an announcement so big they have to play a new sound cue just to live up to the magnitude of it - you&apos;ll just have to listen. 
Plus can you have jeans sewn into your skin so you never have to change them? 
Serial killers are such a fascinating, but disagreeable bunch of fellas. Have you heard of Ted Bundy? Not nice. We listen to audio of him talking about his favorite activity - killing.
AND it&apos;s the return of our favorite GIGOLO -BRACE. He has a bombshell announcement and gets down and dirty about a lot of his Ho&apos;in details. </itunes:summary>

Joe weighs in on it all, from Biggie vs Beatles to the OG Would You Rather. This is an episode you&apos;re going to love and wear around as you collect denim for the long winter.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>J-J-J-J-Jeans Unit!</p>
<p>This is a very special episode. In addition to being packed with content and the introduction of a new, amazing caller, we here at Your Mom's House are very proud to announce that the Main Mommy, Christina Pazsitzky (PaJeanSky) has released a NEW album!</p>
<p>Man of the Year is Christina's second album and is now available everywhere. Be sure to get a copy so that her jeans reach higher, tigher levels!</p>
<p>Plus the moms get down and talk about Tommy letting Christina do (and say) dumb things. Is it his fault?!? Tina worked out HARD this week. Is cross training fitness not a match for her?</p>
<p>Tommy is in LOVE with another crime show. This one is extra murdery and we break it down for you. Plus "Uncle Bill" whom we have been wanting to have on the show for years is finally here. All we can say about that is - you're not ready. </p>
<p>DENIM!</p>

<p>Man of the Year is Christina's second album and is now available everywhere. Be sure to get a copy so that her jeans reach higher, tigher levels!</p>
<p>Plus the moms get down and talk about Tommy letting Christina do (and say) dumb things. Is it his fault?!? Tina worked out HARD this week. Is cross training fitness not a match for her?</p>
<p>Tommy is in LOVE with another crime show. This one is extra murdery and we break it down for you. Plus "Uncle Bill" whom we have been wanting to have on the show for years is finally here. All we can say about that is - you're not ready. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>What is love? When you've been someone long enough that you can say, "That's stupid of you," and then they respond, "Then I'm stupid. Let me be stupid!" That's true love. It's real contempt under a thin layer of decency that says, "I know I have to live with you." </p>
<p>When people have been together more than 50 years it can be quite colorfully spoken. </p>
<p>A fun game you can play with your significant other is ask strangers how old they think your partner is and then brace yourself when they (hopefully) guess FAR older. It's a real HOOT.</p>
<p>Plus Tom hung out with an older man in a sauna. Did it get weird? Well, they covered cannibalism, prostitution and drugs. So it gets fun. </p>
<p>The brown detectives may have solved an age old mystery. Maybe it will prevent future loose stools. We'll see.</p>
<p>Jeans, this is the final episode of 2014. Let's promise each other one thing, next year, even HIGHER!</p>

We have an original song that&apos;s gonna blow your jeans off, plus some Asian talk that sounds eerily familiar. Paging Sharkeisha - Honey are you there?!?
If you loosen your jeans for this episode you&apos;ll never forgive yourself. </itunes:subtitle>

<p>If you're down in the 954 or the 305 and you see a half naked white dude singing and dancing shakin' that thang - don't worry, that's Rihanna.</p>

      <itunes:summary>Whenever you see a microphone anywhere that is an opportunity. The possibility now exists that you can grab that mic and you can fart in it. This is how we even the playing field in life. A homeless man and a Greek billionaire suddenly become the same living being - a mic farter. 
King A** Ripper is an international treasure for a reason. He seizes the opportunities that others ignore. He never, EVER passes on the chance to drop heat for the rest of us. Thank you Hairy N Gross Glutton. You inspire us all. International super star Nicki Minaj got the hint (okay it wasn&apos;t her) and now has a real hit on her hands!
Plus Theo heard the song that all the Mommy&apos;s are talking about and, you guessed it, he wants his cut. Tina tries to reason with him, but there&apos;s no taking the hood out of this pooch. 
Tina is a big NERD and wears undies during a massage (MOMSSAGE). Are you the same type of NERD that she is? If you&apos;re a flight attendant please keep the jokes inside of your head. You&apos;re the WORST!
And finally Half Ounce drops some crazy Ya know what I&apos;m talkin about, ya feel me, ya know what I mean? And Tina thinks he has some BIG WORDS too!</itunes:summary>

      <title>Jason Nash-226-Your Mom&apos;s House with Christina Pazsitzky and Tom Segura</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Jason Nash Is Married. This is not only a factual statement, but also the name of a new movie written by, directed by and starring our very special guest, Jason Nash. Tina Jeans became good buds with Nash over the last month as they both filmed the top secret show that you now know about. We love Jason for a lot of reasons, but his honesty about marraige and parenthood might top it all. If his movie is anything like this conversation we cannot wait to see it! </p>
<p>Plus don't look at, approach, pet, whistle towards or think of another persons dog and a HUGE Dental Update from Tina's bestie, amazing audio and more! </p>

<p>Tommy and Tina discuss how many more marriages they'll go thru. More than 3? That seems like too many. Maybe we should just sign a good ol' C*m dog up to hang out around the house. Sean Connery approves! </p>

But some people are an interesting mix up of both. We break it down for you. You might be surprised when we listen to the greatest song of our generation and strip it down to it's suspiciously "special" voice. Are all children actually retard(ed) sounding? A "Bad Girl" asks if you know what she's saying, but she has a special twist! Plus a hockey player throws hit hat in the ring as he drops a mountain of "You Know's" in an interview. Wear HEADPHONES for this one!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Get out of that Country A** nonsense, pull up your denim and get ready for the get down. We got a hot new anthem for REAL MOMMIES ONLY. Plus, Tommy ran into Joey "Try Eating This and Living" Diaz on a flight and, yeah, meltdown came soon after. Real husbands say, "Show me how those big T**s fart" to their wives and maybe now, you will too? Pastor Manning is completely insane and we have the audio to prove it. REAL TALK is back and we are ready to ROAST the Duggars wildly selfish lifestyle. This episode is offensive. </p>

We have pretty compelling evidence that suggests that President Obama listens to the show and keeps up with the YMH lingo. Maybe he'll be on the show soon? Hope so. If you and your boys are planning on getting together for a fun night of bro'ing down you should get a Naughty Boy and take that party to the next level! It's been a minute, but TOP DOG is back and he's got one of his "great ideas." Plus, you guessed it, he has a dump story. As if that didn't make you shart your shorts, there's MORE! OMG Maria is on this ep! She tells the uh, "story" of her latest car accident and names a new leader when it comes to foreigners who's language skills/attitudes upset her. You're not ready! </p>

Dude has some good points and a LOT of job stoppers (you'll soon understand). A man violated the safety and sanctity of our neighborhood in front of Tina and inTO a Yoplait (possible future sponsor?). We go to the Forensic Files to see if we can solve the case! Do families that masturbate together just, basically, get along the best? We just don't know. Tina left behind a life in the KGB to come to the US of A and today is the anniversary. Will she be allowed to stay? Obama decides! Wiping with a MAN'S wipe is new for Lady Jeans. We can't wait for her review. Most IMPORTANTLY we break down the new and accepted criteria for crowning the You Know What I'm Sayin Champion and it's a real GAME CHANGER. It's spring time, get that seasonal denim out! </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>It never gets old. No matter how much time passes by, joy is always spread when someone drops a Deez Nuts joke. And if you get it on TV? Well, we collectively thank you, sir. New music from you, the little jeans, is welcomed and celebrated! It's time to post a challenge! Does a pimp or a rapper say You Know What Im Sayin more?

Yes, there's a new champ in the You Know What I'm Sayin circle and it is GLORIOUS! Tina and Tommy both have Brown issues - You've been warned. Is or isn't the man we both see homeless? The Jeans are DIVIDED. Plus Jerry Lewis is still obnoxious and we have a first hand account from comedian and writer Megan Beth Koester (@bornferal). It's ridiculous and hilarious.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Ari Shaffir AKA Airey Schaeffer is in the building. Sure he put some loose change we had lying around in his pocket, but we still enjoyed his company. Did you ever hear the joke that if we want to win a war we should just send gangbangers to fight them because they love shooting people anyway? Yeah, that's happening. Some OG Sorenos from the 818 are droppin dimes on fools in Syria and the audio is amazing. We have a MAJOR Dental Update - Tina had something SERIOUS done, jeans. Hear the wrath of Ari towards TSA and celebrate Tommy's new special and album. You know what we're sayin? Plus Ari's brown talk will have you cringing, possibly crying and certainly mailing him fiber bars. </p>

It's always nice to have your kid come home from college and for this hour we wonder if he's ever going to class anymore. We cover life, teeth, Sharkeisha, paranoia and a whole lot more. Does Redban have a secret brother??? Maybe. Does a girl who sells you her dirty panties excite Brian? We think so. Does he tells us the grossest thing ever and nearly causes the show to stop? Yes.

<p>Tommy had to go potty bad and it almost came out in the car! Tina laughed and that's not nice. Do you think that Robin Wright makes possible suitors sniff her snuff spot? Tommy thinks so.

We provide insight into every race and culture's attempt to say what they're saying. Do you know what each of them mean? Perhaps Tom should add to his "Black vault" of voices as he nails the homeless, nude gay man getting penetrated in the streets. Don't disrespect judges, know what we're all sayin? Lots of music in this one plus some choice Would You Rather's. Give your mother a hug! J-J-J-Jeans Unit!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>When you find something you love to do in life, don't settle for anything but being the best. Even if that thing is taking it in every hole all day until your insides fall out of you. That's what Ava Devine has done and we have the audio to prove it. Plus Theo gets on the mic after a little hiatus and he is pretty fired up. Everyone has fun when they fart. Everyone plays with their butt cheeks to throw the pitch of their farts. Well, everyone EXCEPT Tina. Tina claims she does NOT do this and the mommies get to the bottom of the truth. REAL TALK is back with something beyond comprehension - eating ones own mattress. Oh boy, you better buckle your belt (that you wear to support your jeans). </p>

When Carla goes to Wendy(sic) or Burger King she doesn't get the respect she is owed (MacDonald's(sic) doesn't do her like that). Who is the real leader of sayin "you know what I'm sayin?" Do you know what we're asking here? If you have a whole weight, keep going. Make yourself very, very fat and then make videos and money. Your dreams can be your reality! Plus you know we got that JJ Fish joint you been dying to hear. Get those jeans on and PULL THEM UP. "No, you have a good muthaf***in' night." - Carla</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I've been wanting to see what's in those Jeans for a long time! Oh, get your dirty mind out of my jeans. Cab drivers are hot and we all want a piece of them. Our favorite part about riding around with cabbies is their smell but also their cleanliness and also listening to their nice music and also when they ignore our requests. Yeah, that's about it. Shakey Jeans is gone, but who will replace him? Hopefully someone with a more debilitating condition. Is the NFL ready for a gay player? What if an entire team were gay and amazingly talented? We pray for this. Tom and Tina talk about their new business idea - which involves juice and dudes. We got Brown Talk, a NEW release from the King (A** Ripper), a wanna-be tough guy and MORE! </p>

      <title>192-Your Mom&apos;s House with Christina Pazsitzky and Tom Segura</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>It's not bad to consider that if you're not good at something then you should quit! And if you don't quit then hopefully Eric Kelly will appear at the thing you're not good at and make fun of you. On camera. Shout out to all the little mommies that are down for the git down! We give you a proper salute. The live show was the Jimmy Jam and you the man, man. Sometimes when people who love each other eat together, they also end up blowing burp wind on each other (or just one way). The C-word is a fun word. Stop being so sensitive, you stupid C-word. We wear are JEANS so high for YOU!!!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you're gay I challenge you to up your game. Listen to the gayest man that has ever lived and see if you can top him, if even, for a moment. When ladies OR guys can't control the joy they feel when they taste man yogurt in their mouth are you buying it? We kind of disagree on this point. I mean clearly people LOVE it. The drunkest man ever is revisited and it's undeniable - he's a huge fan of our show. You know what I'm sayin, you gotta gun yoself, you know I'm sayin? Yes, sir, we do. Do we have an impromptu WOULD YOU RATHER that is so awful you might not answer? Yup. Nancy Grace is a lying turd, but maybe pot does make you kill??? David Lee Roth and Flocka rock out for you. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Every animal can get diarrhea, but why did that animal get that loose brown? Let's talk about it. Top Dog and Charo get a surprise phone call about Tom's sex education class memory. Was there a VERY out-of-line teacher? Hmmmmm. Did Top Dog make big BROWN on his latest cruise? We finished Breaking Bad Farts and we tip our collective hat to all the participants. It's a masterpiece and we miss it already. Pop music is for the stupid by the slightly less stupid. This isn't an attempt to be controversial. We actually have proof. If English is your first language and you make Dennis Rodman sound like Prince William what would be your next move? These JEAN were made for talking (to your mom). </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Seems like it's pretty much settled - TOMMY IS THE MAIN MOMMY. Episode 19 is revisited and the evidence is CLEAR. Christina is filing appeals, but we doubt there's a judge in the land that will grant her another hearing. We debate this at length and allow you to decide. You went CRAZY over the appearance of Juelz Ventura on episode 188 and we celebrate the triumph. Yes, we're proud of ourselves. What's scarier than a man dressed as a female DOLL? We vote nothing. It is absolutely terrifying. A new show is coming out about it and we are mortified and eager to watch it. Homeless people singing the hits is something that we hope takes off! They really can't sing, but we want it to never end. DENIM NEVER ENDS.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>HONESTLY, we feel like you're going to leave this episode like, "Whoa, I'm proud of myself." Thanks to you, the dedicated little mommy that could, we have managed to land an all-time favorite and MY OH MY did we have fun. Adult superstar, Juelz Ventura is as laid back and fun as she is sexy and full of drool (we'll let her explain). We get to ask everything we've ever wanted to ask to someone who does the dirty on camera and we get answers that you won't be able to wrap your loose vagina around. Juelz is game for anything and shares the inside scoop that we've been yearning for. Oh yeah, when we finally get to the clip that you all love, well, it's magic. This episode has heart, laughs, boobs and honestly, what else could you want? </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Great news! Dennis Rodman isn't retarded. That is, of course, according to Dennis Rodman. He's just really, really drunk and he wishes he had been alive many years ago, to befriend Hitler, the often-lambasted and widely "misunderstood" former German leader. But we've got to be honest. We're not really buying the drunk thing. Drunks, well, sound different - like Orson Welles! MUAAAAHAAAHHHHHHH, the French Champagne, blllllahhhhhhh! Stevie Wonder is a world treasure. He should maybe cut his braids. All dudes who play ball should cut their dreads. ALL. Some of our favorite artists MUST be horrible people, but not you, Stevie. We play some old Top Dog and Charo clips just because we love you. </p>

He's just really, really drunk and he wishes he had been alive many years ago, to befriend Hitler, the often-lambasted and widely "misunderstood" former German leader. But we've got to be honest. We're not really buying the drunk thing. Drunks, well, sound different - like Orson Welles! MUAAAAHAAAHHHHHHH, the French Champagne, blllllahhhhhhh! Stevie Wonder is a world treasure. He should maybe cut his braids. All dudes who play ball should cut their dreads. ALL. Some of our favorite artists MUST be horrible people, but not you, Stevie. We play some old Top Dog and Charo clips just because we love you. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode is very CHILDISH in the way that we make fun of other living people. We hope you are okay with that. Former NBA player and current mentally retarded person, Dennis Rodman is, well, definitely not the best at speaking outloud. He's in North Korea and he is apparently mumbling his way back. Why are there no more PSA's? Did we solve everything for kids and now they no longer need warnings? Lets bring them back and make them lamer than ever. Fire, kid touchers and drugs are still around so how about we be adults again and start making bad commericals about them for the children, yo. We learned that Kim Jong-Un is a huge fan of the show, but we are not so sure about going over there to do a live show. Something about that guy (City Connection). The mommies are eating healthy and the brown is falling out of us! You will enjoy this show or you will spend the next 15 years in our fart labor camp. </p>
