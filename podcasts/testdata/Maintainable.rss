      <title>Cory House - Finding Opportunities for Improvement</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Cory House (he/him/his), the Founder at Reactjsconsulting.com, a software developer, author, speaker, and consultant. “I love the old saying that we write software for humans. So, I think about that regularly”, Cory says about what the maintainability of software is all about. When it comes down to it, he thinks more about his fellow developers than the compiler. He talks about the importance of good variable naming, shares the tactics for writing good tests for your regular expressions, and lists the benefits of automating pull-request feedback on potentially subjective feedback so that we can focus our attention on objective curiosities. </p><p>He will also dive into testing strategies for React JS applications, how granular unit testing patterns don't apply well to automated browser tests, why it's valuable to keep a running list of opportunities for improvements rather than a list of technical debt, and why he believes that not every software project requires a dedicated architect but there should be someone who is acting in that role.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Henrik Warne (he/him/his), the Senior Software Engineer at Talos. In Henrik’s view of well-maintained software, he talks about the importance of code having structure early on because, without structure, code tends to inevitably drift over time toward complexity.

      <title>Marianne Bellotti - Building Empathy by Asking, &quot;How Would You Write This in 2007?&quot;</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Marianne Bellotti (she/her/hers), the Engineering Manager at Rebellion Defense. Marianne is the author of the books, <i>“Hiring Engineers”</i> and <i>“Kill it with Fire”</i>.

On the top of Noah’s list of things that facilitate the maintainability of software is team dynamics. Well-maintained software can never be achieved by a single individual refactoring code or having grand ideas/visions.

      <title>Ben Parisot - Documentation Just Needs To Be Used Once</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with the Engineering Manager at Planet Argon, Ben Parisot. Ben has worked in the tech industry since 2010 and has worn many, many hats: blogger, web designer, web developer, technical producer, scrum master, technical project manager, copywriter, and more. He loves all parts of the software development lifecycle and always has a creative personal web or mobile app humming along outside of work. The first thing Ben says he looks for that represents well-maintained software is thorough and up-to-date documentation. </p><p>He feels that every developer or project manager must ensure that they leave a good paper trail of the work they do. He encourages engineering teams to do regular documentation audits of internal and external documentation they use in order to find outdated and obsolete documentation. Drawing from his experience working on multiple client projects, his advice is to build processes around auditing and improving documentation to make sure it's effective. This convo will prove incredibly valuable as he shares some tips on how engineering teams can go about that based on the projects they work on and so much more.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Andrea Goulet, the CEO of Corgibytes, a software development shop dedicated to maintaining and modernizing software applications. Named by LinkedIn as one of the top ten professionals in software under 35, Andrea is the host of the podcast Legacy Code Rocks, is the author of the forthcoming book, <i>“Empathy-Driven Software Development”</i>, has co-founded several successful technology companies, and has taught over 50,000 students how to turn soft skills like empathy and communication into software skills.</p><p>Through her newest venture, Heartware.dev, she is on a mission to operationalize empathy for tech teams and keynotes frequently about building a business based on balance, empathy, and trust; the perils of the technical/non-technical divide; and the technical philosophies around working with legacy code. Andrea says that the maintainability of software comes down to trust and while she doesn't find the term technical debt useful, she uses it in instances where it’s being widely used especially in software remodeling projects. From her experience, the term is not useful at all when dealing with business-minded people who view debt differently.</p><p>She points out that the success of a project is always highly dependent on the project owner and the team working on their project having shared goals as they approach the writing of software. Robby and Andrea will also dive into why we should avoid deferring to other people and defaulting to being ticket takers, how empathy has different definitions, avoiding us vs them thinking, and so much more.

Ousterhout was a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley where he created the Tcl scripting language and the Tk platform-independent widget toolkit and proposed the idea of co-scheduling.

      <title>Courtney Wilburn - Maintainable Software Has Good Community Around It</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Courtney Wilburn (She/Her/Hers), the Sr. Engineering Manager at Elastic Cloud, the leading platform for search-powered solutions. She is an experienced DevOps Engineer, speaker, and writer. With solutions in enterprise search, observability, and security, Elastic helps enhance customer and employee search experiences, keep mission-critical applications running smoothly, and protect against cyber threats. For Courtney, well-maintained software is all about software having a good community around it that is enthusiastic about its long-term success. </p><p>She shares her expertise on the traits of excellent documentation and talks about how engineers should go about joining a software team. Courtney uses the metaphor technical debt and she will graciously break down how her team discusses, prioritizes, and documents what and when they focus on it. She also talks about the challenges that come with process debt, how to go about hiring junior-level engineers, and what we can do to foster mentorship in our teams. It’s going to be a very interesting conversation so don’t miss out.</p><h2>Book Recommendations:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.akpress.org/emergentstrategy.html" target="_blank">Emergent Strategy: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds By Adrienne Maree Brown</a></li></ul><h2>Helpful Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/cjwilburn" target="_blank">Courtney on Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://cjwilburn.com" target="_blank">Courney’s Website</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cjwilburn/" target="_blank">Courtney on LinkedIn</a></li></ul><p><strong>Subscribe to Maintainable on:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/maintainable/id1459893010">Apple Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1459893010/maintainable">Overcast</a></li><li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6Ah6xxZ04VQBqjBB5ZU0Ll?si=1ZcnrwoJSNiksYgDqsRmRQ">Spotify</a></li></ul><p>Or search "Maintainable" wherever you stream your podcasts.</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/u8BwA2kvyu" target="_blank">Join the discussion in the Maintainable Discord Community</a></p>

      <title>Casey Watts! - Culturesmithing</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Casey Watts!, the Founder at Happy and Effective and the author of Debugging Your Brain. Their conversation begins with Casey calling out engineers who go about the maintainability of their software by just cleaning stuff up instinctually instead of having a deliberately prioritized engineering backlog. He talks about the importance of team leaders giving engineers leeway to choose when to explore and try things, and even take some free time. That enables the engineers to feel more autonomous and have more ownership. </p><p>Casey also shares strategies for managing technical debt and how teams can invest in moving faster. And on the topic of team culture, he will dig into the concept of culturesmithing and talk about the five levers that can be used to make changes happen, for example, in engineering and prioritization of backlogs. You will get to learn about the service engagements that Happy and Effective offers and gain so much more value in this candid 44-minute conversation that Robby and Casey had.

      <title>Marc Cornellà - Maintaining Open Source Projects</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Marc Cornellà, the official maintainer and major contributor for the Oh My Zsh project. Marc will start off by sharing his wisdom on the characteristics of well-maintained proprietary software. He will also tell us whether the same characteristics apply when it comes to open-source software. Marc started contributing to open-source projects back in 2011 when he worked on a university project that generated schedules for new students. In 2015, he transitioned to Oh My Zsh, which has been the biggest project he’s ever worked on. </p><p>Oh My Zsh is a framework for Z Shell that allows engineers to install and use different themes that one can personalize according to the look and feel of their terminal. It has 200+ plugins and about 100 themes. It not only allows one to use plugins and themes from other projects, but also offers thousands of helpful functions, helpers, and so much more. The great thing about Oh My Zsh is that an engineer doesn't have to be an advanced hacker to use it. </p><p>Marc will among many other things share strategies that can be used to help organize and prioritize a popular project that has a consistent 400 to 500 open pull requests from people across the planet, and some future ideas for Oh My Zsh.

      <title>Shanea Leven - How To Bring Visibility To Your Codebase</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with the CEO and Co-Founder of CodeSee, Shanea Leven. The conversation starts with Shanea’s insights on the relatively unknown shift left movement which, from her own hands-on experience, has been a very great way for engineers to write maintainable and resilient code. The shift left movement emphasizes on moving, understanding, and visualizing code while moving everything closer to development when one is writing their code instead of waiting until things are in production. That has proven to be very helpful as codebases increase in size and complexity because it enables engineers to catch things before they write their code. </p><p>Shanea talks about the importance of code visibility (Being able to visually summarize how your code is working at every step of the development process before production) and how to go about it. She shares how the code visibility movement is helping engineers overcome the challenges they face when they go into legacy codebases to try and refactor them and get them back to their clients in a way that the clients can be able to maintain them. Tune in as Robby and Shanea dive into a lot more juicy topics around managing documentation, how CodeSee offers great value to engineers, tech debt, spatial reasoning, and much more.</p><h2>Book Recommendations:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://cruciallearning.com/crucial-conversations-book/" target="_blank">Crucial Conversations</a></li></ul><h2>Helpful Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.codesee.io/" target="_blank">Codesee</a></li><li><a href="https://learn.codesee.io/" target="_blank">Codesee Learn</a></li><li><a href="https://opensourcehub.io/" target="_blank">Open Source Hub</a></li><li><a href="https://learn.codesee.io/learn-to-code-smarter-how-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer-quickly/" target="_blank">Blog post discussing spatial reasoning</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0ilf05C-hE" target="_blank">Talk including discussion on spatial reasoning </a></li></ul><p><strong>Subscribe to Maintainable on:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/maintainable/id1459893010">Apple Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1459893010/maintainable">Overcast</a></li><li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6Ah6xxZ04VQBqjBB5ZU0Ll?si=1ZcnrwoJSNiksYgDqsRmRQ">Spotify</a></li></ul><p>Or search "Maintainable" wherever you stream your podcasts.</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/u8BwA2kvyu" target="_blank">Join the discussion in the Maintainable Discord Community</a></p>

      <title>Chelsea Troy - All Code Has Maintenance Load</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Chelsea Troy, the Staff Software Engineer on machine learning and backend systems at Mozilla. Chelsea also maintains the Zooniverse Citizens Science mobile app, the NASA landslide data processing pipeline, and a few other open-source projects. She is a maintainer for the rock programming language and mentors formerly incarcerated technologists through Emergent Works. She teaches Python and mobile development at the University of Chicago’s Master's program in Computer Science, hosts workshops for O’Reilly, and writes at <a href="http://chelseatroy.com">ChelseaTroy.com</a>  </p><p>For Chelsea, one of the most important characteristics of well-maintained software is a conscious effort to ensure that enough context remains available for engineers who come in without existing familiarity with the system to gain that context and maintain it. She shares more of her valuable insights on how we can go about making software more maintainable and explains why she’s not a proponent of the term “Technical debt”. </p><p>She also talks about some of the strategies she uses to quantify maintenance work, how engineers can document their code with more helpful error messages that provide more context, and how to discuss the removal of features to reduce long-term maintenance load with a product team.

      <title>Ben Halpern - Adventures In Open Sourcing Your Existing Application</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Ben Halpern, the creator of <a href="https://dev.to/">Dev.to</a> and a Co-Founder of Forem, a platform that Dev.to is based on. Ben shares from his experience, that well-maintained software needs to have a clear purpose and context that’s available as one is reading it and within the documentation as needed while also being flexible for future evolution.

      <title>Avdi Grimm - Don&apos;t Be Too Clingy To Your Tests</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a candid conversation with Avdi Grimm, a software developer, consultant, coach, speaker, and author of the books, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Confident-Ruby-Patterns-Joyful-Coding-ebook/dp/B00ETE0D2S">“Confident Ruby”</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11799211-exceptional-ruby">“Exceptional Ruby”</a> He is also the creator and head gardener of<a href="https://graceful.dev"> Graceful.Dev</a>. Avdi’s opinion on well-maintained software is that it’s more about teams than code and the fact that more attention need to be paid on documentation. He emphasizes the value of useful commit messages and conveying the why over the how. He also shares examples of executable documentation. </p><p>Robby and Avdi dive into what technical debt looks like for different teams and how it can either be taken as a serious course of action or just as a term for areas of friction in a codebase. Avdi shares his experience in organizing technical debt-type tasks and highlights the importance of teams being able to articulate and quantify friction. As organizations continue to adopt the DevOps mindset, there is lingering debate as to whether it is more of a philosophy or a role. </p><p>Avdi believes that DevOps is less a role and a philosophy, an approach to lifecycle management and how teams are organized around that outlook. Stay tuned to sample more of what Avdi had to share in this resourceful 44-minute episode.</p><h2>Book Recommendations:</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Life-Trees-Communicate_Discoveries-Secret/dp/1771642483">The Hidden Life of Trees: What They Feel, How They Communicate – Discoveries from a Secret World</a></li></ul><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Life-Trees-Communicate_Discoveries-Secret/dp/1771642483">Resources Mentioned:</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://itrevolution.com/the-phoenix-project/">The Phoenix Project by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford </a></li><li><a href="https://teamtopologies.com/book">Team Topologies - by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais</a></li><li><a href="https://sidneydekker.com/books/">The Field Guide to Understanding 'Human Error'  by Sidney Dekker</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Confident-Ruby-Patterns-Joyful-Coding-ebook/dp/B00ETE0D2S">Confident Ruby By Avdi Grimm</a></li><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11799211-exceptional-ruby">Exceptional Ruby By Avdi Grimm </a></li></ul><h2><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11799211-exceptional-ruby">Helpful Links</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avdigrimm/">Avdi’s LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/avdi">Avdi’s Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/avdi">Avdi on GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM-D8NDdOj9c4jvg7MtGNjg">Avdi on YouTube</a></li><li><a href="https://graceful.dev">Graceful.Dev</a></li></ul><p>Subscribe to Maintainable on:</p><ul><li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/maintainable/id1459893010">Apple Podcasts</a></li><li><a href="https://overcast.fm/itunes1459893010/maintainable">Overcast</a></li><li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6Ah6xxZ04VQBqjBB5ZU0Ll?si=1ZcnrwoJSNiksYgDqsRmRQ">Spotify</a></li></ul><p>Or search "Maintainable" wherever you stream your podcasts.</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/u8BwA2kvyu" target="_blank">Join the discussion in the Maintainable Discord Community</a></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Robby has a chat with Aran Khanna, the Co-Founder, and CEO of Archera, a company that helps organizations find cloud solutions that fit their companies. Aran starts off by sharing that great functional decomposition, brevity, and simple but high coverage tests are, from his experience, the three common characteristics of well-maintained software. He then shares his wisdom on the importance of brevity in code and documentation, when and where copy/paste is appropriate, and how to get a better handle on your costs of cloud resources to better predict future utilization and pricing.</p><p>He also shares what problems Archera.ai solves for its customers and how Archera captures, estimates, and prioritizes its own technical debt.
