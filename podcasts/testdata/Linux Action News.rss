        <![CDATA[<p>Chris and Joe look back at the big news stories of 2017, some notable trends, the changes that impacted Desktop Linux users, and the topics that dominated the community discussion. </p><p><a href="https://www.jupiter.party/" rel="payment">Support Linux Action News</a></p><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2017-January/028660.html" title="Arch Drops 32 bit" rel="nofollow">Arch Drops 32 bit</a> &mdash; The decision means that February ISO will be the last that allows to
install 32 bit Arch Linux. The next 9 months are deprecation period,
during which i686 will be still receiving upgraded packages. Starting
from November 2017, packaging and repository tools will no longer
require that from maintainers, effectively making i686 unsupported.

Bitcoin Cash removes an important technical obstacle that has hampered the growth of the mainline Bitcoin network. In principle, that could allow Bitcoin Cash to become more widely used—and hence more valuable—in the long run.</li><li><a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3ykaw/yet-another-bitcoin-fork-aims-to-take-power-away-from-big-miners" title="And Forked Again" rel="nofollow">And Forked Again</a> &mdash; The trouble began earlier this year when a group of cryptocurrency upstarts cloned Bitcoin to create their own version, called Bitcoin Cash. The split, called a "hard fork," came after a long and acrimonious disagreement about how to get Bitcoin to handle more traffic failed to resolve amicably. Now, another group of Bitcoiners wants to create yet another version of the world's most popular digital money on October 25. They're calling it Bitcoin Gold.</li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/29/16714322/bitcoin-surge-10000" title="And jumped around 20x in value this year" rel="nofollow">And jumped around 20x in value this year</a> &mdash; Bitcoin is now worth over $10,000. The cryptocurrency, which crossed the milestone for the first time since its creation in 2008, surged past $10,000 on Tuesday evening as it climbs toward $11,000, according to research site CoinDesk.

        <![CDATA[<p>Chris and Joe look back at the big news stories of 2017, some notable trends, the changes that impacted Desktop Linux users, and the topics that dominated the community discussion. </p><p><a href="https://www.jupiter.party/" rel="payment">Support Linux Action News</a></p><p>Links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2017-January/028660.html" title="Arch Drops 32 bit" rel="nofollow">Arch Drops 32 bit</a> &mdash; The decision means that February ISO will be the last that allows to
install 32 bit Arch Linux. The next 9 months are deprecation period,
during which i686 will be still receiving upgraded packages. Starting
from November 2017, packaging and repository tools will no longer
require that from maintainers, effectively making i686 unsupported.
</li><li><a href="https://tails.boum.org/news/Tails_3.0_will_require_a_64-bit_processor/index.en.html" title="Tails 3.0 will require a 64-bit processor" rel="nofollow">Tails 3.0 will require a 64-bit processor</a> &mdash; We have waited for years until we felt it was the right time to do this switch. Still, this was a hard decision for us to make.</li><li><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Ubuntu-17.10-Drops-i386-ISO" title="Ubuntu 17.10 Will Drop The 32-bit Desktop ISO" rel="nofollow">Ubuntu 17.10 Will Drop The 32-bit Desktop ISO</a> &mdash;  There will no longer be any "ubuntu-desktop-i386.iso" produced. There is no longer any effective QA or testing being done on the Ubuntu i386 desktop image on actual 32-bit-only hardware. </li><li><a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/11/13/munich_committee_says_all_windows_2020/" title="Munich voted to return to Windows" rel="nofollow">Munich voted to return to Windows</a> &mdash; Munich city council's administrative and personnel committee has decided to move any remaining Linux systems to Windows 10 in 2020.</li><li><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/11/ubuntu-arrives-in-the-windows-store-suse-and-fedora-are-coming-to-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/" title="WSL added new distros and became easier to install" rel="nofollow">WSL added new distros and became easier to install</a> &mdash; At its Build 2017 developer conference today, Microsoft announced that Ubuntu has arrived in the Windows Store</li><li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/08/why-the-bitcoin-network-just-split-in-half-and-why-it-matters/" title="Bitcoin Forked" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin Forked</a> &mdash; It was created by Bitcoin supporters worried about growing congestion in the mainstream bitcoin network that has led to slow payment processing and high fees. Bitcoin Cash removes an important technical obstacle that has hampered the growth of the mainline Bitcoin network. In principle, that could allow Bitcoin Cash to become more widely used—and hence more valuable—in the long run.</li><li><a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d3ykaw/yet-another-bitcoin-fork-aims-to-take-power-away-from-big-miners" title="And Forked Again" rel="nofollow">And Forked Again</a> &mdash; The trouble began earlier this year when a group of cryptocurrency upstarts cloned Bitcoin to create their own version, called Bitcoin Cash. The split, called a "hard fork," came after a long and acrimonious disagreement about how to get Bitcoin to handle more traffic failed to resolve amicably. Now, another group of Bitcoiners wants to create yet another version of the world's most popular digital money on October 25. They're calling it Bitcoin Gold.</li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/29/16714322/bitcoin-surge-10000" title="And jumped around 20x in value this year" rel="nofollow">And jumped around 20x in value this year</a> &mdash; Bitcoin is now worth over $10,000.
