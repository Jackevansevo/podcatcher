    <title>Offline with Jon Favreau</title>
    <description>Offline with Jon Favreau is a different kind of Sunday show – a chance to step away from our Twitter-fueled news cycles to hear smarter, lighter conversations about all the ways that our extremely online existence is shaping everything from politics and culture to the how we live, work, and interact with one another. After more than a dozen conversations with guests like Stephen Colbert, Monica Lewinsky, Jia Tolentino, and Roxane Gay, it’s clear that people want these conversations to continue – that they’re interested in figuring out how we can regain control over our chaotic, hyperconnected world.
That’s why Offline is here to stay. In the coming months, Jon will dig deeper into the internet abyss and beyond, exploring new topics with new guests from the worlds of news, politics, entertainment, sports, business, and more. Join Jon each week as he asks us to put down our screens, grab our headphones, and figure out how to live happier, healthier lives, both on and offline.</description>

      <itunes:summary>Dr. Lynn Vavreck, professor of political scientist at UCLA and contributing columnist to The Upshot at The New York Times, sits down with Jon to talk about 2022 midterms. After 2020, Lynn and her colleagues interviewed over 500,000 voters, leading them to conclude that our politics aren’t just polarized, but calcified. She argues that calcification has placed our politics on a knife’s edge, raising the stakes of every election and that 2022 was the biggest case of calcification we’ve seen yet.</itunes:summary>
